<h2><a name="The_Humorous_Ghost" id="The_Humorous_Ghost"></a>The Humorous Ghost</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>The humorous ghost is distinctly a modern
character. In early literature wraiths took themselves
very seriously, and insisted on a proper show
of respectful fear on the part of those whom they
honored by haunting. A mortal was expected to
rise when a ghost entered the room, and in case he
was slow about it, his spine gave notice of what
etiquette demanded. In the event of outdoor apparition,
if a man failed to bare his head in awe,
the roots of his hair reminded him of his remissness.
Woman has always had the advantage over
man in such emergency, in that her locks, being
long and pinned up, are less easily moved&mdash;which
may explain the fact (if it be a fact!) that in fiction
women have shown themselves more self-possessed
in ghostly presence than men. Or possibly a
woman knows that a masculine spook is, after all,
only a man, and therefore may be charmed into
helplessness, while the feminine can be seen
through by another woman and thus disarmed.
The majority of the comic apparitions, curiously
enough, are masculine. You don't often find
women wraithed in smiles&mdash;perhaps because they
resent being made ridiculous, even after they're
dead. Or maybe the reason lies in the fact that
men have written most of the comic or satiric
ghost stories, and have chivalrously spared the
gentler shades. And there are very few funny
child-ghosts&mdash;you might almost say none, in comparison
with the number of grown-ups. The number
of ghost children of any or all types is small
proportionately&mdash;perhaps because it seems an
unnatural thing for a child to die under any circumstances,
while to make of him a butt for jokes
would be unfeeling. There are a few instances,
as in the case of the ghost baby mentioned later,
but very few.</p>

<p>Ancient ghosts were a long-faced lot. They
didn't know how to play at all. They had been
brought up in stern repression of frivolities as
haunters&mdash;no matter how sportive they may have
been in life&mdash;and in turn they cowed mortals into
a servile submission. No doubt they thought of
men and women as mere youngsters that must be
taught their place, since any living person, however
senile, would be thought juvenile compared with a
timeless spook.</p>

<p>But in these days of individualism and radical
liberalism, spooks as well as mortals are expanding
their personalities and indulging in greater freedom.
A ghost can call his shade his own now, and
exhibit any mood he pleases. Even young female
wraiths, demanding latchkeys, refuse to obey the
frowning face of the clock, and engage in light-hearted
ebullience to make the ghost of Mrs.
Grundy turn a shade paler in horror. Nowadays
haunters have more fun and freedom than the
haunted. In fact, it's money in one's pocket
these days to be dead, for ghosts have no rent
problems, and dead men pay no bills. What
officer would willingly pursue a ghostly tenant to
his last lodging in order to serve summons on him?
And suppose a ghost brought into court demanded
trial by a jury of his peers? No&mdash;manifestly
death has compensations not connected with the
consolations of religion.</p>

<p>The marvel is that apparitions were so long in
realizing their possibilities, in improving their
advantages. The specters in classic and medieval
literature were malarial, vaporous beings without
energy to do anything but threaten, and mortals
never would have trembled with fear at their frown
if they had known how feeble they were. At best
a revenant could only rattle a rusty skeleton, or
shake a moldy shroud, or clank a chain&mdash;but as
mortals cowered before his demonstrations, he
didn't worry. If he wished to evoke the extreme
of anguish from his host, he raised a menacing arm
and uttered a windy word or two. Now it takes
more than that to produce a panic. The up-to-date
ghost keeps his skeleton in a garage or some
place where it is cleaned and oiled and kept in
good working order. The modern wraith has
sold his sheet to the old clo'es man, and dresses as
in life. Now the ghost has learned to have a
variety of good times, and he can make the living
squirm far more satisfyingly than in the past.
The spook of to-day enjoys making his haunted
laugh even while he groans in terror. He knows
that there's no weapon, no threat, in horror, to be
compared with ridicule.</p>

<p>Think what a solemn creature the Gothic ghost
was! How little originality and initiative he
showed and how dependent he was on his own
atmosphere for thrills! His sole appeal was to the
spinal column. The ghost of to-day touches the
funny bone as well. He adds new horrors to being
haunted, but new pleasures also. The modern
specter can be a joyous creature on occasion, as
he can be, when he wishes, fearsome beyond the
dreams of classic or Gothic revenant. He has a
keen sense of humor and loves a good joke on a
mortal, while he can even enjoy one on himself.
Though his fun is of comparatively recent origin&mdash;it's
less than a century since he learned to crack
a smile&mdash;the laughing ghost is very much alive
and sportively active. Some of these new spooks
are notoriously good company. Many Americans
there are to-day who would court being haunted
by the captain and crew of Richard Middleton's
Ghost Ship that landed in a turnip field and dispensed
drink till they demoralized the denizens of
village and graveyard alike. After that show of
spirits, the turnips in that field tasted of rum, long
after the ghost ship had sailed away into the blue.</p>

<p>The modern spook is possessed not only of
humor but of a caustic satire as well. His jest is
likely to have more than one point to it, and he can
haunt so insidiously, can make himself so at home
in his host's study or bedroom that a man actually
welcomes a chat with him&mdash;only to find out
too late that his human foibles have been mercilessly
flayed. Pity the poor chap in H. C. Bunner's
story, <i>The Interfering Spook</i>, for instance,
who was visited nightly by a specter that repeated
to him all the silly and trite things he had said
during the day, a ghost, moreover, that towered
and swelled at every hackneyed phrase, till
finally he filled the room and burst after the young
man proposed to his admired one, and made subsequent
remarks. Ghosts not only have appallingly
long memories, but they possess a mean
advantage over the living in that they have once
been mortal, while the men and women they haunt
haven't yet been ghosts. Suppose each one of us
were to be haunted by his own inane utterances?
True, we're told that we'll have to give account
Some Day for every idle word, but recording angels
seem more sympathetic than a sneering ghost at
one's elbow. Ghosts can satirize more fittingly
than anyone else the absurdities of certain psychic
claims, as witness the delightful seriousness of
the story <i>Back from that Bourne</i>, which appeared
as a front page news story in the New York <i>Sun</i>
years ago. I should think that some of the futile,
laggard messenger-boy ghosts that one reads about
nowadays would blush with shame before the
wholesome raillery of the porgy fisherman.</p>

<p>The modern humorous ghost satirizes everything
from the old-fashioned specter (he's very
fond of taking pot-shots at him) to the latest
psychic manifestations. He laughs at ghosts
that aren't experts in efficiency haunting, and he
has a lot of fun out of mortals for being scared of
specters. He loves to shake the lugubrious terrors
of the past before you, exposing their hollow
futility, and he contrives to create new fears for
you magically while you are laughing at him.</p>

<p>The new ghost hates conventionality and uses
the old thrills only to show what dead batteries
they come from. His really electrical effects are
his own inventions. He needs no dungeon keeps
and monkish cells to play about in&mdash;not he! He
demands no rag nor bone nor clank of chain of his
old equipment to start on his career. He can
start up a moving picture show of his own, as in
Ruth McEnery Stuart's <i>The Haunted Photograph</i>,
and demonstrate a new kind of apparition. The
ghost story of to-day gives you spinal sensations
with a difference, as in the immortal <i>Transferred
Ghost</i>, by Frank R. Stockton, where the suitor on
the moonlit porch, attempting to tell his fair
one that he dotes on her, sees the ghost of her
ferocious uncle (who isn't dead!) kicking his heels
against the railing, and hears his admonition that
he'd better hurry up, as the live uncle is coming in
sight. The thrill with which you read of the ghost
in Ellis Parker Butler's <i>The Late John Wiggins</i>,
who deposits his wooden leg with the family he is
haunting, on the plea that it is too materialistic to
be worn with ease, and therefore they must take
care of it for him, doesn't altogether leave you
even when you discover that the late John is a
fraud, has never been a ghost nor used a wooden
leg. But a terrifying leg-acy while you do believe
in it!</p>

<p>The new ghost has a more nimble and versatile
tongue as well as wit. In the older fiction and
drama apparitions spoke seldom, and then merely
as <i>ghosts</i>, not as individuals. And ghosts, like
kings in drama, were of a dignity and must preserve
it in their speech. Or perhaps the authors
were doubtful as to the dialogue of shades, and
compromised on a few stately ejaculations as being
safely phantasmal speaking parts. But compare
that usage with the rude freedom of some modern
spooks, as John Kendrick Bangs's spectral cook of
Bangletop, who lets fall her h's and twists grammar
in a rare and diverting manner. For myself, I'd
hate to be an old-fashioned ghost with no chance
to keep up with the styles in slang. Think of
having always&mdash;and always&mdash;to speak a dead
language!</p>

<p>The humorous ghost is not only modern, but he
is distinctively American. There are ghosts of all
nationalities, naturally, but the spook that provides
a joke&mdash;on his host or on himself&mdash;is Yankee
in origin and development. The dry humor, the
comic sense of the incongruous, the willingness to
laugh at himself as at others, carry over into
immaterialization as characteristic American
qualities and are preserved in their true flavor.
I don't assert, of course, that Americans have been
the only ones in this field. The French and English
selections in this volume are sufficient to
prove the contrary. Gautier's <i>The Mummy's
Foot</i> has a humor of a lightness and grace as delicate
as the princess's little foot itself. There are
various English stories of whimsical haunting,
some of actual spooks and some of the hoax type.
Hoax ghosts are fairly numerous in British as in
American literature, one of the early specimens of
the kind being <i>The Specter of Tappington</i> in the
<i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>. The files of <i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i> reveal several examples, though not of
high literary value.</p>

<p>Of the early specimens of the really amusing
ghost that is an actual revenant is <i>The Ghost Baby</i>,
in <i>Blackwood's</i>, which shows originality and humor,
yet is too diffuse for printing here. In that we
have a conventional young bachelor, engaged to a
charming girl, who is entangled in social complications
and made to suffer mental torment because,
without his consent, he has been chosen as the
nurse and guardian of a ghost baby that cradles
after him wherever he goes. This is a rich story
almost spoiled by being poorly told. I sigh to
think of the laughs that Frank R. Stockton or
John Kendrick Bangs or Gelett Burgess could
have got out of the situation. There are other
comic British spooks, as in Baring-Gould's <i>A
Happy Release</i>, where a widow and a widower in
love are haunted by the jealous ghosts of their
respective spouses, till the phantom couple take
a liking to each other and decide to let the living
bury their dead. This is suggestive of Brander
Matthews's earlier and cleverer story of a spectral
courtship, in <i>The Rival Ghosts</i>. Medieval and
later literature gave us many instances of a love
affair or marriage between one spirit and one mortal,
but it remained for the modern American to
celebrate the nuptials of two ghosts. Think of
being married when you know that you and the
other party are going to live ever after&mdash;whether
happily or no! Truly, the present terrors are
more fearsome than the old!</p>

<p>The stories by Eden Phillpotts and Richard
Middleton in this collection show the diversity of
the English humor as associated with apparitions,
and are entertaining in themselves. The <i>Canterville
Ghost</i>, by Oscar Wilde, is one of his best
short stories and is in his happiest vein of laughing
satire. This travesty on the conventional traditions
of the wraith is preposterously delightful,
one of the cleverest ghost stories in our language.
Zangwill has written engagingly of spooks, with
a laughable story about Samuel Johnson. And
there are others. But the fact remains that in
spite of conceded and admirable examples, the
humorous ghost story is for the most part American
in creation and spirit. Washington Irving
might be said to have started that fashion in
skeletons and shades, for he has given us various
comic haunters, some real and some make-believe.
Frank R. Stockton gave his to funny spooks with a
riotous and laughing pen. The spirit in his <i>Transferred
Ghost</i> is impudently deathless, and has
called up a train of subsequent haunters. John
Kendrick Bangs has made the darker regions seem
comfortable and homelike for us, and has created
ghosts so human and so funny that we look forward
to being one&mdash;or more. We feel downright
neighborly toward such specters as the futile &ldquo;last
ghost&rdquo; Nelson Lloyd evokes for us, as we appreciate
the satire of Rose O'Neill's sophisticated wraith.
The daring concept of Gelett Burgess's Ghost Extinguisher
is altogether American. The field is still
comparatively limited, but a number of Americans
have done distinctive work in it. The
specter now wears motley instead of a shroud,
and shakes his jester's bells the while he rattles his
bones. I dare any, however grouchy, reader to
finish the stories in this volume without having
a kindlier feeling toward ghosts!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By OSCAR WILDE</span></h4>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister,
bought Canterville Chase, everyone told him
he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no
doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed,
Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the
most punctilious honor, had felt it his duty to
mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to
discuss terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,&rdquo;
said Lord Canterville, &ldquo;since my grand-aunt,
the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was
frightened into a fit, from which she never really
recovered, by two skeleton hands being placed on
her shoulders as she was dressing for dinner, and I
feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has
been seen by several living members of my family,
as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus
Dampier, who is a Fellow of King's College,
Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the
Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay
with us, and Lady Canterville often got very little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious
noises that came from the corridor and the
library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo; answered the Minister, &ldquo;I will
take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I
have come from a modern country, where we have
everything that money can buy; and with all our
spry young fellows painting the Old World red,
and carrying off your best actors and prima-donnas,
I reckon that if there were such a thing as
a ghost in Europe, we'd have it at home in a very
short time in one of our public museums, or on the
road as a show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear that the ghost exists,&rdquo; said Lord Canterville,
smiling, &ldquo;though it may have resisted the
overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It has
been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in
fact, and always makes its appearance before the
death of any member of our family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so does the family doctor for that matter,
Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir,
as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Nature are not
going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are certainly very natural in America,&rdquo;
answered Lord Canterville, who did not quite
understand Mr. Otis's last observation, &ldquo;and if you
don't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right.
Only you must remember I warned you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded,
and at the close of the season the Minister
and his family went down to Canterville Chase.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of
West 53d Street, had been a celebrated New York
belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged
woman, with fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many
American ladies on leaving their native land adopt
an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the
impression that it is a form of European refinement,
but Mrs. Otis had never fallen into this
error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a
really wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed,
in many respects, she was quite English, and
was an excellent example of the fact that we have
really everything in common with America nowadays,
except, of course, language. Her eldest son,
christened Washington by his parents in a moment
of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was
a fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who
had qualified himself for American diplomacy by
leading the German at the Newport Casino for
three successive seasons, and even in London was
well known as an excellent dancer. Gardenias and
the peerage were his only weaknesses. Otherwise
he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis
was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn,
and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes.
She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once raced
old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park,
winning by a length and a half, just in front of the
Achilles statue, to the huge delight of the young
Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the
spot, and was sent back to Eton that very night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by his guardians, in floods of tears. After Virginia
came the twins, who were usually called &ldquo;The Stars
and Stripes,&rdquo; as they were always getting swished.
They were delightful boys, and, with the exception
of the worthy Minister, the only true republicans
of the family.</p>

<p>As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot,
the nearest railway station, Mr. Otis had telegraphed
for a wagonette to meet them, and they
started on their drive in high spirits. It was a
lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with
the scent of the pinewoods. Now and then they
heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet
voice, or saw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished
breast of the pheasant. Little squirrels
peered at them from the beech-trees as they went
by, and the rabbits scudded away through the
brushwood and over the mossy knolls, with their
white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue
of Canterville Chase, however, the sky became
suddenly overcast with clouds, a curious stillness
seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great flight of
rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before
they reached the house, some big drops of rain had
fallen.</p>

<p>Standing on the steps to receive them was an
old woman, neatly dressed in black silk, with a
white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the
housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's
earnest request, had consented to keep in
her former position. She made them each a low<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
curtsy as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned
manner, &ldquo;I bid you welcome to Canterville
Chase.&rdquo; Following her, they passed through
the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low
room, paneled in black oak, at the end of which
was a large stained glass window. Here they found
tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their
wraps, they sat down and began to look round,
while Mrs. Umney waited on them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red
stain on the floor just by the fireplace, and, quite
unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs.
Umney, &ldquo;I am afraid something has been spilled
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; replied the old housekeeper in a
low voice, &ldquo;blood has been spilled on that spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How horrid!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Otis; &ldquo;I don't at all
care for blood-stains in a sitting-room. It must be
removed at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman smiled, and answered in the same
low, mysterious voice, &ldquo;It is the blood of Lady
Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that
very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville,
in 1575. Sir Simon survived her nine
years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious
circumstances. His body has never been
discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the
Chase. The blood-stain has been much admired
by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all nonsense,&rdquo; cried Washington Otis;
&ldquo;Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Detergent will clean it up in no time,&rdquo; and
before the terrified housekeeper could interfere,
he had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scouring
the floor with a small stick of what looked like
a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of
the blood-stain could be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew Pinkerton would do it,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
triumphantly, as he looked round at his admiring
family; but no sooner had he said these words than
a terrible flash of lightning lit up the somber room,
a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to
their feet, and Mrs. Umney fainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a monstrous climate!&rdquo; said the American
Minister, calmly, as he lit a long cheroot. &ldquo;I
guess the old country is so overpopulated that they
have not enough decent weather for everybody.
I have always been of opinion that emigration is
the only thing for England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Hiram,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Otis, &ldquo;what can
we do with a woman who faints?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charge it to her like breakages,&rdquo; answered the
Minister; &ldquo;she won't faint after that&rdquo;; and in a
few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.
There was no doubt, however, that she was extremely
upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to
beware of some trouble coming to the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;that would make any Christian's hair stand
on end, and many and many a night I have not
closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that
are done here.&rdquo; Mr. Otis, however, and his wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
warmly assured the honest soul that they were not
afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings
of Providence on her new master and mistress, and
making arrangements for an increase of salary, the
old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The storm raged fiercely all that night, but
nothing of particular note occurred. The next
morning, however, when they came down to breakfast,
they found the terrible stain of blood once
again on the floor. &ldquo;I don't think it can be the
fault of the Paragon Detergent,&rdquo; said Washington,
&ldquo;for I have tried it with everything. It must
be the ghost.&rdquo; He accordingly rubbed out the
stain a second time, but the second morning it
appeared again. The third morning also it was
there, though the library had been locked up at
night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried upstairs.
The whole family were now quite interested;
Mr. Otis began to suspect that he had
been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of
ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining
the Psychical Society, and Washington prepared a
long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the
subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains
when connected with Crime. That night all doubts
about the objective existence of phantasmata were
removed forever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the
cool of the evening, the whole family went out to
drive. They did not return home till nine o'clock,
when they had a light supper. The conversation
in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not
even those primary conditions of receptive expectations
which so often precede the presentation of
psychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as
I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely
such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured
Americans of the better class, such as the immense
superiority of Miss Fanny Devonport over Sarah
Bernhardt as an actress; the difficulty of obtaining
green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in
the best English houses; the importance of Boston
in the development of the world-soul; the advantages
of the baggage-check system in railway traveling;
and the sweetness of the New York accent
as compared to the London drawl. No mention
at all was made of the supernatural, nor was Sir
Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At
eleven o'clock the family retired, and by half-past
all the lights were out. Some time after, Mr. Otis
was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor,
outside his room. It sounded like the clank of
metal, and seemed to be coming nearer every
moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and
looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock.
He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was
not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued,
and with it he heard distinctly the sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of footsteps. He put on his slippers, took a small
oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened
the door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan
moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect. His eyes
were as red burning coals; long gray hair fell over
his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which
were of antique cut, were soiled and ragged, and
from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles
and rusty gyves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Otis, &ldquo;I really must
insist on your oiling those chains, and have brought
you for that purpose a small bottle of the Tammany
Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely
efficacious upon one application, and there
are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper
from some of our most eminent native divines.
I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles,
and will be happy to supply you with more, should
you require it.&rdquo; With these words the United
States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble
table, and, closing his door, retired to rest.</p>

<p>For a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite
motionless in natural indignation; then, dashing
the bottle violently upon the polished floor, he fled
down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and
emitting a ghastly green light. Just, however, as
he reached the top of the great oak staircase, a
door was flung open, two little white-robed figures
appeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head!
There was evidently no time to be lost, so, hastily
adopting the Fourth dimension of Space as a means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting,
and the house became quite quiet.</p>

<p>On reaching a small secret chamber in the left
wing, he leaned up against a moonbeam to recover
his breath, and began to try and realize his position.
Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of
three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted.
He thought of the Dowager Duchess,
whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before
the glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four
housemaids, who had gone into hysterics when he
merely grinned at them through the curtains on
one of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the
parish, whose candle he had blown out as he was
coming late one night from the library, and who
had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever
since, a perfect martyr to nervous disorders; and of
old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having wakened
up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in
an arm-chair by the fire reading her diary, had been
confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack
of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become
reconciled to the Church, and broken off her connection
with that notorious skeptic, Monsieur de
Voltaire. He remembered the terrible night when
the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking
in his dressing-room, with the knave of diamonds
halfway down his throat, and confessed, just
before he died, that he had cheated Charles James
Fox out of &pound;50,000 at Crockford's by means of
that very card, and swore that the ghost had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
him swallow it. All his great achievements came
back to him again, from the butler who had shot
himself in the pantry because he had seen a green
hand tapping at the windowpane, to the beautiful
Lady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a
black velvet band round her throat to hide the
mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin, and
who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the
end of the King's Walk. With the enthusiastic
egotism of the true artist, he went over his most
celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to
himself as he recalled to mind his last appearance
as &ldquo;Red Reuben, or the Strangled Babe,&rdquo; his <i>d&eacute;but</i>
as &ldquo;Gaunt Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley
Moor,&rdquo; and the <i>furore</i> he had excited one lovely
June evening by merely playing ninepins with his
own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And
after all this some wretched modern Americans
were to come and offer him the Rising Sun Lubricator,
and throw pillows at his head! It was quite
unbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever
been treated in this manner. Accordingly, he determined
to have vengeance, and remained till
daylight in an attitude of deep thought.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The next morning, when the Otis family met at
breakfast, they discussed the ghost at some length.
The United States Minister was naturally a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
annoyed to find that his present had not been
accepted. &ldquo;I have no wish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to do the
ghost any personal injury, and I must say that,
considering the length of time he has been in the
house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows
at him,&rdquo;&mdash;a very just remark, at which, I am
sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter.
&ldquo;Upon the other hand,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if he
really declines to use the Rising Sun Lubricator,
we shall have to take his chains from him. It
would be quite impossible to sleep, with such a
noise going on outside the bedrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the rest of the week, however, they were
undisturbed, the only thing that excited any attention
being the continual renewal of the blood-stain
on the library floor. This certainly was very
strange, as the door was always locked at night by
Mr. Otis, and the windows kept closely barred.
The chameleon-like color, also, of the stain excited
a good deal of comment. Some mornings it
was a dull (almost Indian) red, then it would be
vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they
came down for family prayers, according to the
simple rites of the Free American Reformed Episcopalian
Church, they found it a bright emerald-green.
These kaleidoscopic changes naturally
amused the party very much, and bets on the subject
were freely made every evening. The only
person who did not enter into the joke was little
Virginia, who, for some unexplained reason, was
always a good deal distressed at the sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it
was emerald-green.</p>

<p>The second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday
night. Shortly after they had gone to bed
they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in
the hall. Rushing downstairs, they found that a
large suit of old armor had become detached from
its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor, while
seated in a high-backed chair was the Canterville
ghost, rubbing his knees with an expression of
acute agony on his face. The twins, having
brought their pea-shooters with them, at once discharged
two pellets on him, with that accuracy of
aim which can only be attained by long and careful
practice on a writing-master, while the United
States Minister covered him with his revolver,
and called upon him, in accordance with Californian
etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost
started up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept
through them like a mist, extinguishing Washington
Otis's candle as he passed, and so leaving them
all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the
staircase he recovered himself, and determined to
give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter.
This he had on more than one occasion found extremely
useful. It was said to have turned Lord
Raker's wig gray in a single night, and had certainly
made three of Lady Canterville's French
governesses give warning before their month was
up. He accordingly laughed his most horrible
laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a
door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light
blue dressing-gown. &ldquo;I am afraid you are far from
well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and have brought you a bottle of
Doctor Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you
will find it a most excellent remedy.&rdquo; The ghost
glared at her in fury, and began at once to make
preparations for turning himself into a large black
dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly
renowned, and to which the family doctor always
attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's
uncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound
of approaching footsteps, however, made him hesitate
in his fell purpose, so he contented himself
with becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished
with a deep churchyard groan, just as the
twins had come up to him.</p>

<p>On reaching his room he entirely broke down,
and became a prey to the most violent agitation.
The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross materialism
of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying,
but what really distressed him most was that
he had been unable to wear the suit of mail. He
had hoped that even modern Americans would be
thrilled by the sight of a Specter in armor, if for
no more sensible reason, at least out of respect for
their national poet Longfellow, over whose graceful
and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away
many a weary hour when the Cantervilles were up
in town. Besides it was his own suit. He had
worn it with great success at the Kenilworth tournament,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and had been highly complimented on it
by no less a person than the Virgin Queen herself.
Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely
overpowered by the weight of the huge
breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen heavily
on the stone pavement, barking both his knees
severely, and bruising the knuckles of his right
hand.</p>

<p>For some days after this he was extremely ill,
and hardly stirred out of his room at all, except to
keep the blood-stain in proper repair. However,
by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and
resolved to make a third attempt to frighten the
United States Minister and his family. He selected
Friday, August 17th, for his appearance, and spent
most of that day in looking over his wardrobe,
ultimately deciding in favor of a large slouched
hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet frilled at
the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards
evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the
wind was so high that all the windows and doors in
the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was
just such weather as he loved. His plan of action
was this. He was to make his way quietly to
Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the
foot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the
throat to the sound of low music. He bore Washington
a special grudge, being quite aware that it
was he who was in the habit of removing the
famous Canterville blood-stain by means of Pinkerton's
Paragon Detergent. Having reduced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of
abject terror, he was then to proceed to the room
occupied by the United States Minister and his
wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs.
Otis's forehead, while he hissed into her trembling
husband's ear the awful secrets of the charnel-house.
With regard to little Virginia, he had not
quite made up his mind. She had never insulted
him in any way, and was pretty and gentle. A
few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought,
would be more than sufficient, or, if that failed to
wake her, he might grabble at the counterpane
with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins,
he was quite determined to teach them a lesson.
The first thing to be done was, of course, to sit
upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling sensation
of nightmare. Then, as their beds were
quite close to each other, to stand between them
in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse, till they
became paralyzed with fear, and finally, to throw
off the winding-sheet, and crawl round the room,
with white, bleached bones and one rolling eyeball
in the character of &ldquo;Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's
Skeleton,&rdquo; a <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in which he had on more than one
occasion produced a great effect, and which he
considered quite equal to his famous part of &ldquo;Martin
the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At half-past ten he heard the family going to
bed. For some time he was disturbed by wild
shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the
light-hearted gayety of schoolboys, were evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
amusing themselves before they retired to rest,
but at a quarter-past eleven all was still, and, as
midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat
against the window-panes, the raven croaked from
the old yew-tree, and the wind wandered moaning
round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family
slept unconscious of their doom, and high above
the rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring
of the Minister for the United States. He stepped
stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile
on his cruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her
face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel
window, where his own arms and those of his murdered
wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On
and on he glided, like an evil shadow, the very
darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed. Once
he thought he heard something call, and stopped;
but it was only the baying of a dog from the Red
Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth
century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the
rusty dagger in the midnight air. Finally he
reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless
Washington's room. For a moment he paused
there, the wind blowing his long gray locks about
his head, and twisting into grotesque and fantastic
folds the nameless horror of the dead man's shroud.
Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the
time was come. He chuckled to himself, and
turned the corner; but no sooner had he done so
than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and
hid his blanched face in his long, bony hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Right in front of him was standing a horrible
specter, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous
as a madman's dream! Its head was bald
and burnished; its face round, and fat, and white;
and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its
features into an eternal grin. From the eyes
streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a
wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like to his
own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form.
On its breast was a placard with strange writing
in antique characters, some scroll of shame it
seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful
calendar of crime, and, with its right hand, it bore
aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.</p>

<p>Never having seen a ghost before, he naturally
was terribly frightened, and, after a second hasty
glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to his
room, tripping up in his long winding-sheet as he
sped down the corridor, and finally dropping the
rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-boots, where
it was found in the morning by the butler. Once
in the privacy of his own apartment, he flung himself
down on a small pallet-bed, and hid his face
under the clothes. After a time, however, the
brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he
determined to go and speak to the other ghost as
soon as it was daylight. Accordingly, just as the
dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned
towards the spot where he had first laid
eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling that, after all,
two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
aid of his new friend, he might safely grapple with
the twins. On reaching the spot, however, a
terrible sight met his gaze. Something had evidently
happened to the specter, for the light had
entirely faded from its hollow eyes, the gleaming
falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning
up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable
attitude. He rushed forward and seized
it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped
off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent
posture, and he found himself clasping a
white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush,
a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his
feet! Unable to understand this curious transformation,
he clutched the placard with feverish
haste, and there, in the gray morning light, he read
these fearful words:</p>

<div class="bbox">
YE OTIS GHOSTE<br />
Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook,<br />
Beware of Ye Imitationes.<br />
All others are counterfeite.<br />
</div>

<p class="noindent">The whole thing flashed across him. He had been
tricked, foiled, and outwitted! The old Canterville
look came into his eyes; he ground his toothless
gums together; and, raising his withered hands
high above his head, swore according to the picturesque
phraseology of the antique school, that,
when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry
horn, deeds of blood would be wrought, and murder
walk abroad with silent feet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Hardly had he finished this awful oath when,
from the red-tiled roof of a distant homestead, a
cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh,
and waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the
cock, for some strange reason, did not crow again.
Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of the housemaids
made him give up his fearful vigil, and he
stalked back to his room, thinking of his vain oath
and baffled purpose. There he consulted several
books of ancient chivalry, of which he was exceedingly
fond, and found that, on every occasion on
which this oath had been used, Chanticleer had
always crowed a second time. &ldquo;Perdition seize
the naughty fowl,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I have seen the
day when, with my stout spear, I would have run
him through the gorge, and made him crow for
me an 'twere in death!&rdquo; He then retired to a
comfortable lead coffin, and stayed there till
evening.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The next day the ghost was very weak and
tired. The terrible excitement of the last four
weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves
were completely shattered, and he started at the
slightest noise. For five days he kept his room,
and at last made up his mind to give up the point
of the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
family did not want it, they clearly did not deserve
it. They were evidently people on a low, material
plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating
the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena.
The question of phantasmic apparitions, and the
development of astral bodies, was of course quite a
different matter, and really not under his control.
It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor
once a week, and to gibber from the large oriel
window on the first and third Wednesdays in every
month, and he did not see how he could honorably
escape from his obligations. It is quite true
that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other
hand, he was most conscientious in all things connected
with the supernatural. For the next three
Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor
as usual between midnight and three o'clock,
taking every possible precaution against being
either heard or seen. He removed his boots, trod
as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards,
wore a large black velvet cloak, and was careful to
use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains.
I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good
deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt
this last mode of protection. However, one night,
while the family were at dinner, he slipped into
Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He
felt a little humiliated at first, but afterwards was
sensible enough to see that there was a great deal
to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree,
it served his purpose. Still, in spite of everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
he was not left unmolested. Strings were
continually being stretched across the corridor,
over which he tripped in the dark, and on one
occasion, while dressed for the part of &ldquo;Black
Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods,&rdquo; he met
with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide,
which the twins had constructed from the
entrance of the Tapestry Chamber to the top of
the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged him
that he resolved to make one final effort to assert
his dignity and social position, and determined to
visit the insolent young Etonians the next night in
his celebrated character of &ldquo;Reckless Rupert, or
the Headless Earl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not appeared in this disguise for more
than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so
frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means
of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement
with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather,
and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome
Jack Castletown, declaring that nothing in the
world would induce her to marry into a family
that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up
and down the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was
afterwards shot in a duel by Lord Canterville on
Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of
a broken heart at Tunbridge Wells before the year
was out, so, in every way, it had been a great
success. It was, however, an extremely difficult
&ldquo;make-up,&rdquo; if I may use such a theatrical expression
in connection with one of the greatest mysteries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of the supernatural, or, to employ a more
scientific term, the higher-natural world, and it
took him fully three hours to make his preparations.
At last everything was ready, and he was
very pleased with his appearance. The big leather
riding-boots that went with the dress were just a
little too large for him, and he could only find one
of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was
quite satisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided
out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor.
On reaching the room occupied by the twins, which
I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber
on account of the color of its hangings, he found
the door just ajar. Wishing to make an effective
entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug
of water fell right down on him, wetting him to the
skin, and just missing his left shoulder by a couple
of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled
shrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post
bed. The shock to his nervous system was so great
that he fled back to his room as hard as he could go,
and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold.
The only thing that at all consoled him in the
whole affair was the fact that he had not brought
his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences
might have been very serious.</p>

<p>He now gave up all hope of ever frightening this
rude American family, and contented himself, as a
rule, with creeping about the passages in list slippers,
with a thick red muffler round his throat for
fear of draughts, and a small arquebus, in case he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
should be attacked by the twins. The final blow
he received occurred on the 19th of September.
He had gone downstairs to the great entrance-hall
feeling sure that there, at any rate, he would be
quite unmolested, and was amusing himself by
making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs
of the United States Minister and his wife,
which had now taken the place of the Canterville
family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad
in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mold,
had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and
carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In
fact, he was dressed for the character of &ldquo;Jonas the
Graveless, or the Corpse-Snatcher of Chertsey
Barn,&rdquo; one of his most remarkable impersonations,
and one which the Cantervilles had every reason
to remember, as it was the real origin of their
quarrel with their neighbor, Lord Rufford. It
was about a quarter-past two o'clock in the morning,
and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was
stirring. As he was strolling towards the library,
however, to see if there were any traces left of the
blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from
a dark corner two figures, who waved their arms
wildly above their heads, and shrieked out &ldquo;BOO!&rdquo;
in his ear.</p>

<p>Seized with a panic, which, under the circumstances,
was only natural, he rushed for the staircase,
but found Washington Otis waiting for him
there with the big garden-syringe, and being thus
hemmed in by his enemies on every side, and driven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron
stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and
had to make his way home through the flues and
chimneys, arriving at his own room in a terrible
state of dirt, disorder, and despair.</p>

<p>After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal
expedition. The twins lay in wait for him on
several occasions, and strewed the passages with
nutshells every night to the great annoyance of
their parents and the servants, but it was of no
avail. It was quite evident that his feelings were
so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis
consequently resumed his great work on the history
of the Democratic party, on which he had
been engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organized
a wonderful clam-bake, which amazed the whole
county; the boys took to lacrosse, euchre, poker,
and other American national games, and Virginia
rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by
the young Duke of Cheshire, who had come to
spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville
Chase. It was generally assumed that the ghost
had gone away, and, in fact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter
to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply,
expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent
his best congratulations to the Minister's worthy
wife.</p>

<p>The Otises, however, were deceived, for the
ghost was still in the house, and though now almost
an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters
rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was the young Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle,
Lord Francis Stilton, had once bet a hundred
guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would
play dice with the Canterville ghost, and was found
the next morning lying on the floor of the card-room
in such a helpless paralytic state that, though
he lived on to a great age, he was never able to say
anything again but &ldquo;Double Sixes.&rdquo; The story
was well known at the time, though, of course, out
of respect to the feelings of the two noble families,
every attempt was made to hush it up, and a full
account of all the circumstances connected with it
will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's
<i>Recollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends</i>.
The ghost, then, was naturally very anxious to
show that he had not lost his influence over the
Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected,
his own first cousin having been married <i>en
secondes noces</i> to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from whom,
as everyone knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are
lineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements
for appearing to Virginia's little lover in his
celebrated impersonation of &ldquo;The Vampire Monk,
or the Bloodless Benedictine,&rdquo; a performance so
horrible that when old Lady Startup saw it, which
she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in the
year 1764, she went off into the most piercing
shrieks, which culminated in violent apoplexy, and
died in three days, after disinheriting the Cantervilles,
who were her nearest relations, and leaving
all her money to her London apothecary. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
last moment, however, his terror of the twins prevented
his leaving his room, and the little Duke
slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in
the Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>A few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired
cavalier went out riding on Brockley meadows,
where she tore her habit so badly in getting
through a hedge that, on their return home, she
made up her mind to go up by the back staircase
so as not to be seen. As she was running past the
Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to
be open, she fancied she saw someone inside, and
thinking it was her mother's maid, who sometimes
used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her
to mend her habit. To her immense surprise,
however, it was the Canterville ghost himself!
He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined
gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air, and
the red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue.
His head was leaning on his hand, and his whole
attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed,
so forlorn, and so much out of repair did he look,
that little Virginia, whose first idea had been to
run away and lock herself in her room, was filled
with pity, and determined to try and comfort him.
So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy,
that he was not aware of her presence till
she spoke to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry for you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but my
brothers are going back to Eton to-morrow, and
then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absurd asking me to behave myself,&rdquo; he
answered, looking round in astonishment at the
pretty little girl who had ventured to address him,
&ldquo;quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan
through keyholes, and walk about at night, if that
is what you mean. It is my only reason for existing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no reason at all for existing, and you know
you have been very wicked. Mrs. Umney told us,
the first day we arrived here, that you had killed
your wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I quite admit it,&rdquo; said the ghost, petulantly,
&ldquo;but it was a purely family matter and
concerned no one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very wrong to kill anyone,&rdquo; said Virginia,
who at times had a sweet puritan gravity, caught
from some old New England ancestor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics!
My wife was very plain, never had my ruffs
properly starched, and knew nothing about cookery.
Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley
Woods, a magnificent pricket, and do you know
how she had it sent to table? However, it is no
matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it
was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death,
though I did kill her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost&mdash;I mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Sir Simon, are you hungry? I have a sandwich in
my case. Would you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but
it is very kind of you, all the same, and you are
much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude,
vulgar, dishonest family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Virginia, stamping her foot, &ldquo;it
is you who are rude, and horrid, and vulgar, and as
for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints out
of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous
blood-stain in the library. First you took all my
reds, including the vermilion, and I couldn't do any
more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green
and the chrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing
left but indigo and Chinese white, and could only
do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing
to look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never
told on you, though I was very much annoyed, and
it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who
ever heard of emerald-green blood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said the Ghost, rather meekly,
&ldquo;what was I to do? It is a very difficult thing to
get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother
began it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly
saw no reason why I should not have your paints.
As for color, that is always a matter of taste: the
Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very
bluest in England; but I know you Americans don't
care for things of this kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know nothing about it, and the best thing
you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
My father will be only too happy to give you a free
passage, and though there is a heavy duty on
spirits of every kind, there will be no difficulty
about the Custom House, as the officers are all
Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to
be a great success. I know lots of people there who
would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a
grandfather, and much more than that to have a
family ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think I should like America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose because we have no ruins and no
curiosities,&rdquo; said Virginia, satirically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ruins! no curiosities!&rdquo; answered the Ghost;
&ldquo;you have your navy and your manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the
twins an extra week's holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't go, Miss Virginia,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I am
so lonely and so unhappy, and I really don't know
what to do. I want to go to sleep and I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's quite absurd! You have merely to go
to bed and blow out the candle. It is very difficult
sometimes to keep awake, especially at church, but
there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why,
even babies know how to do that, and they are not
very clever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not slept for three hundred years,&rdquo; he
said sadly, and Virginia's beautiful blue eyes
opened in wonder; &ldquo;for three hundred years I have
not slept, and I am so tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virginia grew quite grave, and her little lips
trembled like rose-leaves. She came towards him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and kneeling down at his side, looked up into his
old withered face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor ghost,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;have you
no place where you can sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far away beyond the pinewoods,&rdquo; he answered,
in a low, dreamy voice, &ldquo;there is a little garden.
There the grass grows long and deep, there are the
great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the
nightingale sings all night long. All night long he
sings, and the cold crystal moon looks down, and
the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the
sleepers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the Garden of Death,&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, death. Death must be so beautiful. To
lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving
above one's head, and listen to silence. To have
no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time,
to forget life, to be at peace. You can help me.
You can open for me the portals of death's house,
for love is always with you, and love is stronger
than death is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through
her, and for a few moments there was silence. She
felt as if she was in a terrible dream.</p>

<p>Then the ghost spoke again, and his voice
sounded like the sighing of the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever read the old prophecy on the
library window?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, often,&rdquo; cried the little girl, looking up;
&ldquo;I know it quite well. It is painted in curious
black letters, and is difficult to read. There are
only six lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><b>&ldquo;'When a golden girl can win</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>Prayer from out the lips of sin,</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>When the barren almond bears,</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>And a little child gives away its tears,</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>Then shall all the house be still</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>And peace come to Canterville.'</b><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">&ldquo;But I don't know what they mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They mean,&rdquo; he said, sadly, &ldquo;that you must
weep with me for my sins, because I have no tears,
and pray with me for my soul, because I have no
faith, and then, if you have always been sweet,
and good, and gentle, the angel of death will have
mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in darkness,
and wicked voices will whisper in your ear,
but they will not harm you, for against the purity
of a little child the powers of Hell cannot prevail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virginia made no answer, and the ghost wrung
his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her
bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very
pale, and with a strange light in her eyes. &ldquo;I am
not afraid,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;and I will ask the
angel to have mercy on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and
taking her hand bent over it with old-fashioned
grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold as ice,
and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
falter, as he led her across the dusky room. On the
faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen.
They blew their tasseled horns and with
their tiny hands waved to her to go back. &ldquo;Go
back! little Virginia,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;go back!&rdquo; but
the ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and she
shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with
lizard tails and goggle eyes blinked at her from the
carven chimney-piece, and murmured, &ldquo;Beware!
little Virginia, beware! we may never see you
again,&rdquo; but the ghost glided on more swiftly, and
Virginia did not listen. When they reached the
end of the room he stopped, and muttered some
words she could not understand. She opened her
eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away like a
mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A
bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt
something pulling at her dress. &ldquo;Quick, quick,&rdquo;
cried the ghost, &ldquo;or it will be too late,&rdquo; and in a
moment the wainscoting had closed behind them,
and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>About ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea,
and, as Virginia did not come down, Mrs. Otis
sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a little
time he returned and said that he could not find
Miss Virginia anywhere. As she was in the habit
of going out to the garden every evening to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at
all alarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck,
and Virginia did not appear, she became really
agitated, and sent the boys out to look for her,
while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room
in the house. At half-past six the boys came back
and said that they could find no trace of their sister
anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state
of excitement, and did not know what to do, when
Mr. Otis suddenly remembered that, some few
days before, he had given a band of gipsies permission
to camp in the park. He accordingly at
once set off for Blackfell Hollow, where he knew
they were, accompanied by his eldest son and two
of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire,
who was perfectly frantic with anxiety, begged
hard to be allowed to go too, but Mr. Otis would
not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a
scuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found
that the gipsies had gone, and it was evident that
their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire
was still burning, and some plates were lying on
the grass. Having sent off Washington and the
two men to scour the district, he ran home, and
dispatched telegrams to all the police inspectors
in the county, telling them to look out for a little
girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or gipsies.
He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and
after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting
down to dinner, rode off down the Ascot road with
a groom. He had hardly, however, gone a couple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after
him, and, looking round, saw the little Duke
coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed,
and no hat. &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,&rdquo; gasped
out the boy, &ldquo;but I can't eat any dinner as long as
Virginia is lost. Please don't be angry with me;
if you had let us be engaged last year, there would
never have been all this trouble. You won't send
me back, will you? I can't go! I won't go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Minister could not help smiling at the handsome
young scapegrace, and was a good deal
touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning
down from his horse, he patted him kindly on the
shoulders, and said, &ldquo;Well, Cecil, if you won't go
back, I suppose you must come with me, but I must
get you a hat at Ascot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!&rdquo; cried
the little Duke, laughing, and they galloped on to
the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of the
station-master if anyone answering to the description
of Virginia had been seen on the platform,
but could get no news of her. The station-master,
however, wired up and down the line, and assured
him that a strict watch would be kept for her, and,
after having bought a hat for the little Duke from
a linen-draper, who was just putting up his shutters,
Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four
miles away, which he was told was a well-known
haunt of the gipsies, as there was a large common
next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman,
but could get no information from him, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
after riding all over the common, they turned their
horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase
about eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heart-broken.
They found Washington and the twins
waiting for them at the gate-house with lanterns,
as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest
trace of Virginia had been discovered. The gipsies
had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she
was not with them, and they had explained their
sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken
the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off
in a hurry for fear they should be late. Indeed,
they had been quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's
disappearance, as they were very grateful
to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his
park, and four of their number had stayed behind
to help in the search. The carp-pond had been
dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone
over, but without any result. It was evident that,
for that night at any rate, Virginia was lost to
them; and it was in a state of the deepest depression
that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the
house, the groom following behind with the two
horses and the pony. In the hall they found a
group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa
in the library was poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her
mind with terror and anxiety, and having her forehead
bathed with eau de cologne by the old housekeeper.
Mr. Otis at once insisted on her having
something to eat, and ordered up supper for the
whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
anyone spoke, and even the twins were awestruck
and subdued, as they were very fond of their sister.
When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the
entreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to
bed, saying that nothing more could be done that
night, and that he would telegraph in the morning
to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent
down immediately. Just as they were passing out
of the dining-room, midnight began to boom from
the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded
they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful
peal of thunder shook the house, a strain of
unearthly music floated through the air, a panel
at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud
noise, and out on the landing, looking very pale
and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped
Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to
her. Mrs. Otis clasped her passionately in her
arms, the Duke smothered her with violent kisses,
and the twins executed a wild war-dance round
the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! child, where have you been?&rdquo;
said Mr. Otis, rather angrily, thinking that she had
been playing some foolish trick on them. &ldquo;Cecil
and I have been riding all over the country looking
for you, and your mother has been frightened to
death. You must never play these practical jokes
any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except on the ghost! except on the ghost!&rdquo;
shrieked the twins, as they capered about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own darling, thank God you are found;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
you must never leave my side again,&rdquo; murmured
Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and
smoothed the tangled gold of her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Virginia, quietly, &ldquo;I have been
with the ghost. He is dead, and you must come
and see him. He had been very wicked, but he
was really sorry for all that he had done, and
he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole family gazed at her in mute amazement,
but she was quite grave and serious; and,
turning round, she led them through the opening
in the wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor,
Washington following with a lighted candle, which
he had caught up from the table. Finally, they
came to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails.
When Virginia touched it, it swung back on its
heavy hinges, and they found themselves in a little
low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny
grated window. Embedded in the wall was a huge
iron ring, and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton,
that was stretched out at full length on the stone
floor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its
long fleshless fingers an old-fashioned trencher and
ewer, that were placed just out of its reach. The
jug had evidently been once filled with water, as
it was covered inside with green mold. There was
nothing on the trencher but a pile of dust. Virginia
knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding
her little hands together, began to pray silently,
while the rest of the party looked on in wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed
to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed one of the twins,
who had been looking out of the window to try
and discover in what wing of the house the room
was situated. &ldquo;Hallo! the old withered almond-tree
has blossomed. I can see the flowers quite
plainly in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God has forgiven him,&rdquo; said Virginia, gravely,
as she rose to her feet, and a beautiful light seemed
to illumine her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an angel you are!&rdquo; cried the young Duke,
and he put his arm round her neck, and kissed her.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Four days after these curious incidents, a funeral
started from Canterville Chase at about
eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn by
eight black horses, each of which carried on its
head a great tuft of nodding ostrich-plumes, and
the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall,
on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville
coat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the
coaches walked the servants with lighted torches,
and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive.
Lord Canterville was the chief mourner,
having come up specially from Wales to attend the
funeral, and sat in the first carriage along with little
Virginia. Then came the United States Minister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and his wife, then Washington and the three boys,
and in the last carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was
generally felt that, as she had been frightened by
the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she
had a right to see the last of him. A deep grave
had been dug in the corner of the churchyard, just
under the old yew-tree, and the service was read in
the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus
Dampier. When the ceremony was over, the servants,
according to an old custom observed in the
Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and,
as the coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia
stepped forward, and laid on it a large cross
made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As she
did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud,
and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard,
and from a distant copse a nightingale began
to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of
the Garden of Death, her eyes became dim with
tears, and she hardly spoke a word during the drive
home.</p>

<p>The next morning, before Lord Canterville went
up to town, Mr. Otis had an interview with him
on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given
to Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially
a certain ruby necklace with old Venetian
setting, which was really a superb specimen of sixteenth-century
work, and their value was so great
that Mr. Otis felt considerable scruples about
allowing his daughter to accept them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know that in this country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to
land, and it is quite clear to me that these jewels
are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must
beg you, accordingly, to take them to London with
you, and to regard them simply as a portion of your
property which has been restored to you under
certain strange conditions. As for my daughter,
she is merely a child, and has as yet, I am glad to
say, but little interest in such appurtenances of
idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who,
I may say, is no mean authority upon Art,&mdash;having
had the privilege of spending several winters in
Boston when she was a girl,&mdash;that these gems are
of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale
would fetch a tall price. Under these circumstances,
Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you will
recognize how impossible it would be for me to
allow them to remain in the possession of any member
of my family; and, indeed, all such vain gauds
and toys, however suitable or necessary to the
dignity of the British aristocracy, would be completely
out of place among those who have been
brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal,
principles of Republican simplicity. Perhaps I
should mention that Virginia is very anxious that
you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento
of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor.
As it is extremely old, and consequently a good
deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to
comply with her request. For my own part, I
confess I am a good deal surprised to find a child of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
mine expressing sympathy with medievalism in
any form, and can only account for it by the fact
that Virginia was born in one of your London suburbs
shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a
trip to Athens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Canterville listened very gravely to the
worthy Minister's speech, pulling his gray moustache
now and then to hide an involuntary smile,
and when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially
by the hand, and said: &ldquo;My dear sir, your
charming little daughter rendered my unlucky
ancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and
I and my family are much indebted to her for her
marvelous courage and pluck. The jewels are
clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were
heartless enough to take them from her, the wicked
old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight,
leading me the devil of a life. As for their being
heirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so
mentioned in a will or legal document, and the
existence of these jewels has been quite unknown.
I assure you I have no more claim on them than
your butler, and when Miss Virginia grows up, I
dare say she will be pleased to have pretty things to
wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took
the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and
anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once
into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir
Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in
point of law he was really dead, and you acquired
his property by purchase.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Mr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord
Canterville's refusal, and begged him to reconsider
his decision, but the good-natured peer was quite
firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his
daughter to retain the present the ghost had given
her, and when, in the spring of 1890, the young
Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's
first drawing-room on the occasion of her marriage
her jewels were the universal theme of admiration.
For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward
of all good little American girls, and was
married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age.
They were both so charming, and they loved each
other so much, that everyone was delighted at the
match, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton,
who had tried to catch the Duke for one of her
seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less
than three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose,
and, strange to say, Mr. Otis himself. Mr.
Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke personally,
but, theoretically, he objected to titles,
and, to use his own words, &ldquo;was not without apprehension
lest, amid the enervating influences of a
pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles
of Republican simplicity should be forgotten.&rdquo;
His objections, however, were completely over-ruled,
and I believe that when he walked up the
aisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his
daughter leaning on his arm, there was not a
prouder man in the whole length and breadth of
England.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>The Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon
was over, went down to Canterville Chase, and on
the day after their arrival they walked over in the
afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pinewoods.
There had been a great deal of difficulty
at first about the inscription on Sir Simon's tombstone,
but finally it had been decided to engrave
on it simply the initials of the old gentleman's
name, and the verse from the library window.
The Duchess had brought with her some lovely
roses, which she strewed upon the grave, and after
they had stood by it for some time they strolled
into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There
the Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her
husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and
looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly he
threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand,
and said to her, &ldquo;Virginia, a wife should have no
secrets from her husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; he answered, smiling, &ldquo;you
have never told me what happened to you when
you were locked up with the ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never told anyone, Cecil,&rdquo; said Virginia,
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, but you might tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you.
Poor Sir Simon! I owe him a great deal. Yes,
don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see
what Life is, and what Death signifies, and why
Love is stronger than both.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have your secret as long as I have your
heart,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have always had that, Cecil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will tell our children some day, won't
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Virginia blushed.</p>

<h2>The Ghost-Extinguisher</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h4>BY GELETT BURGESS</h4>


<p>My attention was first called to the possibility
of manufacturing a practicable ghost-extinguisher
by a real-estate agent in San Francisco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's one thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that affects city
property here in a curious way. You know we
have a good many murders, and, as a consequence,
certain houses attain a very sensational and undesirable
reputation. These houses it is almost
impossible to let; you can scarcely get a decent
family to occupy them rent-free. Then we have a
great many places said to be haunted. These were
dead timber on my hands until I happened to
notice that the Japanese have no objections to
spooks. Now, whenever I have such a building to
rent, I let it to Japs at a nominal figure, and after
they've taken the curse off, I raise the rent, the
Japs move out, the place is renovated, and in the
market again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The subject interested me, for I am not only a
scientist, but a speculative philosopher as well.
The investigation of those phenomena that lie
upon the threshold of the great unknown has
always been my favorite field of research. I believed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
even then, that the Oriental mind, working
along different lines than those which we pursue,
has attained knowledge that we know little of.
Thinking, therefore, that these Japs might have
some secret inherited from their misty past, I
examined into the matter.</p>

<p>I shall not trouble you with a narration of the
incidents which led up to my acquaintance with
Hoku Yamanochi. Suffice it to say that I found
in him a friend who was willing to share with me
his whole lore of quasi-science. I call it this advisedly,
for science, as we Occidentals use the term,
has to do only with the laws of matter and sensation;
our scientific men, in fact, recognize the
existence of nothing else. The Buddhistic philosophy,
however, goes further.</p>

<p>According to its theories, the soul is sevenfold,
consisting of different shells or envelopes&mdash;something
like an onion&mdash;which are shed as life passes
from the material to the spiritual state. The first,
or lowest, of these is the corporeal body, which,
after death, decays and perishes. Next comes the
vital principle, which, departing from the body,
dissipates itself like an odor, and is lost. Less
gross than this is the astral body, which, although
immaterial, yet lies near to the consistency of
matter. This astral shape, released from the body
at death, remains for a while in its earthly environment,
still preserving more or less definitely the
imprint of the form which it inhabited.</p>

<p>It is this relic of a past material personality, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
outworn shell, that appears, when galvanized into
an appearance of life, partly materialized, as a
ghost. It is not the soul that returns, for the soul,
which is immortal, is composed of the four higher
spiritual essences that surround the ego, and are
carried on into the next life. These astral bodies,
therefore, fail to terrify the Buddhists, who know
them only as shadows, with no real volition. The
Japs, in point of fact, have learned how to exterminate
them.</p>

<p>There is a certain powder, Hoku informed me,
which, when burnt in their presence, transforms
them from the rarefied, or semi-spiritual, condition
to the state of matter. The ghost, so to speak,
is precipitated into and becomes a material shape
which can easily be disposed of. In this state it is
confined and allowed to disintegrate slowly where
it can cause no further annoyance.</p>

<p>This long-winded explanation piqued my curiosity,
which was not to be satisfied until I had
seen the Japanese method applied. It was not
long before I had an opportunity. A particularly
revolting murder having been committed in San
Francisco, my friend Hoku Yamanochi applied for
the house, and, after the police had finished their
examination, he was permitted to occupy it for a
half-year at the ridiculous price of three dollars a
month. He invited me to share his quarters, which
were large and luxuriously furnished.</p>

<p>For a week, nothing abnormal occurred. Then,
one night, I was awakened by terrifying groans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
followed by a blood-curdling shriek which seemed
to emerge from a large closet in my room, the scene
of the late atrocity. I confess that I had all the
covers pulled over my head and was shivering with
horror when my Japanese friend entered, wearing
a pair of flowered-silk pajamas. Hearing his voice,
I peeped forth, to see him smiling reassuringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You some kind of very foolish fellow,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I show you how to fix him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from his pocket three conical red pastils,
placed them upon a saucer and lighted them.
Then, holding the fuming dish in one outstretched
hand, he walked to the closed door and opened it.
The shrieks burst out afresh, and, as I recalled the
appalling details of the scene which had occurred
in this very room only five weeks ago, I shuddered
at his temerity. But he was quite calm.</p>

<p>Soon, I saw the wraith-like form of the recent
victim dart from the closet. She crawled under
my bed and ran about the room, endeavoring to
escape, but was pursued by Hoku, who waved his
smoking plate with indefatigable patience and
dexterity.</p>

<p>At last he had her cornered, and the specter was
caught behind a curtain of odorous fumes. Slowly
the figure grew more distinct, assuming the consistency
of a heavy vapor, shrinking somewhat in
the operation. Hoku now hurriedly turned to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hully up, bling me one pair bellows pletty
quick!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>

<p>I ran into his room and brought the bellows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from his fireplace. These he pressed flat, and then
carefully inserting one toe of the ghost into the
nozzle and opening the handles steadily, he sucked
in a portion of the unfortunate woman's anatomy,
and dexterously squirted the vapor into a large jar,
which had been placed in the room for the purpose.
Two more operations were necessary to withdraw
the phantom completely from the corner and empty
it into the jar. At last the transfer was effected and
the receptacle securely stoppered and sealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In formeryore-time,&rdquo; Hoku explained to me,
&ldquo;old pliests sucked ghost with mouth and spit him
to inside of vase with acculacy. Modern-time
method more better for stomach and epiglottis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will this ghost keep?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, about four, five hundled years, maybe,&rdquo;
was his reply. &ldquo;Ghost now change from spilit to
matter, and comes under legality of matter as
usual science.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with her?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send him to Buddhist temple in Japan. Old
pliest use him for high celemony,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>My next desire was to obtain some of Hoku
Yamanochi's ghost-powder and analyze it. For
a while it defied my attempts, but, after many
months of patient research, I discovered that it
could be produced, in all its essential qualities, by
means of a fusion of formaldehyde and hypophenyltrybrompropionic
acid in an electrified vacuum.
With this product I began a series of interesting
experiments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>As it became necessary for me to discover the
habitat of ghosts in considerable numbers, I joined
the American Society for Psychical Research, thus
securing desirable information in regard to haunted
houses. These I visited persistently, until my
powder was perfected and had been proved efficacious
for the capture of any ordinary house-broken
phantom. For a while I contented myself
with the mere sterilization of these specters, but,
as I became surer of success, I began to attempt the
transfer of ghosts to receptacles wherein they could
be transported and studied at my leisure, classified
and preserved for future reference.</p>

<p>Hoku's bellows I soon discarded in favor of a
large-sized bicycle-pump, and eventually I had
constructed one of my own, of a pattern which enabled
me to inhale an entire ghost at a single stroke.
With this powerful instrument I was able to compress
even an adult life-sized ghost into a two-quart
bottle, in the neck of which a sensitive valve
(patented) prevented the specter from emerging
during process.</p>

<p>My invention was not yet, however, quite satisfactory.
While I had no trouble in securing ghosts
of recent creation&mdash;spirits, that is, who were yet of
almost the consistency of matter&mdash;on several of
my trips abroad in search of material I found in
old manor houses or ruined castles many specters
so ancient that they had become highly rarefied
and tenuous, being at times scarcely visible to the
naked eye. Such elusive spirits are able to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
through walls and elude pursuit with ease. It
became necessary for me to obtain some instrument
by which their capture could be conveniently
effected.</p>

<p>The ordinary fire-extinguisher of commerce gave
me the hint as to how the problem could be solved.
One of these portable hand-instruments I filled
with the proper chemicals. When inverted, the
ingredients were commingled in vacuo and a vast
volume of gas was liberated. This was collected
in the reservoir provided with a rubber tube having
a nozzle at the end. The whole apparatus being
strapped upon my back, I was enabled to direct a
stream of powerful precipitating gas in any desired
direction, the flow being under control through the
agency of a small stopcock. By means of this
ghost-extinguisher I was enabled to pursue my
experiments as far as I desired.</p>

<p>So far my investigations had been purely scientific,
but before long the commercial value of my discovery
began to interest me. The ruinous effects
of spectral visitations upon real estate induced me
to realize some pecuniary reward from my ghost-extinguisher,
and I began to advertise my business.
By degrees, I became known as an expert in my
original line, and my professional services were
sought with as much confidence as those of a veterinary
surgeon. I manufactured the Gerrish Ghost-Extinguisher
in several sizes, and put it on the
market, following this venture with the introduction
of my justly celebrated Gerrish Ghost-Grenades.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
These hand-implements were made to be
kept in racks conveniently distributed in country
houses for cases of sudden emergency. A single
grenade, hurled at any spectral form, would, in
breaking, liberate enough formaldybrom to coagulate
the most perverse spirit, and the resulting
vapor could easily be removed from the room by a
housemaid with a common broom.</p>

<p>This branch of my business, however, never
proved profitable, for the appearance of ghosts,
especially in the United States, is seldom anticipated.
Had it been possible for me to invent a preventive
as well as a remedy, I might now be a
millionaire; but there are limits even to modern
science.</p>

<p>Having exhausted the field at home, I visited
England in the hope of securing customers among
the country families there. To my surprise, I discovered
that the possession of a family specter was
considered as a permanent improvement to the
property, and my offers of service in ridding houses
of ghostly tenants awakened the liveliest resentment.
As a layer of ghosts I was much lower in
the social scale than a layer of carpets.</p>

<p>Disappointed and discouraged, I returned home
to make a further study of the opportunities of my
invention. I had, it seemed, exhausted the possibilities
of the use of unwelcome phantoms. Could I
not, I thought, derive a revenue from the traffic
in desirable specters? I decided to renew my
investigations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The nebulous spirits preserved in my laboratory,
which I had graded and classified, were, you will
remember, in a state of suspended animation.
They were, virtually, embalmed apparitions, their
inevitable decay delayed, rather than prevented.
The assorted ghosts that I had now preserved in
hermetically sealed tins were thus in a state of unstable
equilibrium. The tins once opened and the
vapor allowed to dissipate, the original astral body
would in time be reconstructed and the warmed-over
specter would continue its previous career.
But this process, when naturally performed, took
years. The interval was quite too long for the
phantom to be handled in any commercial way. My
problem was, therefore, to produce from my tinned
Essence of Ghost a specter that was capable of
immediately going into business and that could
haunt a house while you wait.</p>

<p>It was not until radium was discovered that I
approached the solution of my great problem, and
even then months of indefatigable labor were
necessary before the process was perfected. It has
now been well demonstrated that the emanations
of radiant energy sent forth by this surprising
element defy our former scientific conceptions of
the constitution of matter. It was for me to prove
that the vibratory activity of radium (whose
amplitudes and intensity are undoubtedly four-dimensional)
effects a sort of allotropic modification
in the particles of that imponderable ether
which seems to lie halfway between matter and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
pure spirit. This is as far as I need to go in my
explanation, for a full discussion involves the use of
quaternions and the method of least squares. It
will be sufficient for the layman to know that my
preserved phantoms, rendered radio-active, would,
upon contact with the air, resume their spectral
shape.</p>

<p>The possible extension of my business now was
enormous, limited only by the difficulty in collecting
the necessary stock. It was by this time almost
as difficult to get ghosts as it was to get radium.
Finding that a part of my stock had spoiled, I was
now possessed of only a few dozen cans of apparitions,
many of these being of inferior quality. I
immediately set about replenishing my raw material.
It was not enough for me to pick up a ghost
here and there, as one might get old mahogany; I
determined to procure my phantoms in wholesale
lots.</p>

<p>Accident favored my design. In an old volume
of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i> I happened, one day, to
come across an interesting article upon the battle
of Waterloo. It mentioned, incidentally, a legend
to the effect that every year, upon the anniversary
of the celebrated victory, spectral squadrons had
been seen by the peasants charging battalions of
ghostly grenadiers. Here was my opportunity.</p>

<p>I made elaborate preparations for the capture of
this job lot of phantoms upon the next anniversary
of the fight. Hard by the fatal ditch which engulfed
Napoleon's cavalry I stationed a corps of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
able assistants provided with rapid-fire extinguishers
ready to enfilade the famous sunken road.
I stationed myself with a No. 4 model magazine-hose,
with a four-inch nozzle, directly in the path
which I knew would be taken by the advancing
squadron.</p>

<p>It was a fine, clear night, lighted, at first, by a
slice of new moon; but later, dark, except for the
pale illumination of the stars. I have seen many
ghosts in my time&mdash;ghosts in garden and garret,
at noon, at dusk, at dawn, phantoms fanciful, and
specters sad and spectacular&mdash;but never have I
seen such an impressive sight as this nocturnal
charge of cuirassiers, galloping in goblin glory to
their time-honored doom. From afar the French
reserves presented the appearance of a nebulous
mass, like a low-lying cloud or fog-bank, faintly
luminous, shot with fluorescent gleams. As the
squadron drew nearer in its desperate charge, the
separate forms of the troopers shaped themselves,
and the galloping guardsmen grew ghastly with
supernatural splendor.</p>

<p>Although I knew them to be immaterial and
without mass or weight, I was terrified at their
approach, fearing to be swept under the hoofs of
the nightmares they rode. Like one in a dream, I
started to run, but in another instant they were
upon me, and I turned on my stream of formaldybrom.
Then I was overwhelmed in a cloud-burst
of wild warlike wraiths.</p>

<p>The column swept past me, over the bank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
plunging to its historic fate. The cut was piled
full of frenzied, scrambling specters, as rank after
rank swept down into the horrid gut. At last the
ditch swarmed full of writhing forms and the carnage
was dire.</p>

<p>My assistants with the extinguishers stood firm,
and although almost unnerved by the sight, they
summoned their courage, and directed simultaneous
streams of formaldybrom into the struggling
mass of fantoms. As soon as my mind returned, I
busied myself with the huge tanks I had prepared
for use as receivers. These were fitted with a
mechanism similar to that employed in portable
forges, by which the heavy vapor was sucked off.
Luckily the night was calm, and I was enabled to
fill a dozen cylinders with the precipitated ghosts.
The segregation of individual forms was, of course,
impossible, so that men and horses were mingled
in a horrible mixture of fricasseed spirits. I intended
subsequently to empty the soup into a
large reservoir and allow the separate specters to
reform according to the laws of spiritual cohesion.</p>

<p>Circumstances, however, prevented my ever
accomplishing this result. I returned home, to
find awaiting me an order so large and important
that I had no time in which to operate upon my
cylinders of cavalry.</p>

<p>My patron was the proprietor of a new sanatorium
for nervous invalids, located near some medicinal
springs in the Catskills. His building was
unfortunately located, having been built upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
site of a once-famous summer hotel, which, while
filled with guests, had burnt to the ground, scores
of lives having been lost. Just before the patients
were to be installed in the new structure, it was
found that the place was haunted by the victims
of the conflagration to a degree that rendered it
inconvenient as a health resort. My professional
services were requested, therefore, to render the
building a fitting abode for convalescents. I wrote
to the proprietor, fixing my charge at five thousand
dollars. As my usual rate was one hundred dollars
per ghost, and over a hundred lives were lost at the
fire, I considered this price reasonable, and my offer
was accepted.</p>

<p>The sanatorium job was finished in a week. I
secured one hundred and two superior spectral
specimens, and upon my return to the laboratory,
put them up in heavily embossed tins with attractive
labels in colors.</p>

<p>My delight at the outcome of this business was,
however, soon transformed to anger and indignation.
The proprietor of the health resort, having
found that the specters from his place had been
sold, claimed a rebate upon the contract price
equal to the value of the modified ghosts transferred
to my possession. This, of course, I could
not allow. I wrote, demanding immediate payment
according to our agreement, and this was
peremptorily refused. The manager's letter was
insulting in the extreme. The Pied Piper of Hamelin
was not worse treated than I felt myself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
be; so, like the piper, I determined to have my
revenge.</p>

<p>I got out the twelve tanks of Waterloo ghost-hash
from the storerooms, and treated them with
radium for two days. These I shipped to the Catskills
billed as hydrogen gas. Then, accompanied
by two trustworthy assistants, I went to the sanatorium
and preferred my demand for payment in
person. I was ejected with contumely. Before my
hasty exit, however, I had the satisfaction of noticing
that the building was filled with patients.
Languid ladies were seated in wicker chairs upon
the piazzas, and frail anemic girls filled the corridors.
It was a hospital of nervous wrecks whom
the slightest disturbance would throw into a panic.
I suppressed all my finer feelings of mercy and
kindness and smiled grimly as I walked back to the
village.</p>

<p>That night was black and lowering, fitting
weather for the pandemonium I was about to turn
loose. At ten o'clock, I loaded a wagon with the
tanks of compressed cohorts, and, muffled in heavy
overcoats, we drove to the sanatorium. All was
silent as we approached; all was dark. The wagon
concealed in a grove of pines, we took out the tanks
one by one, and placed them beneath the ground-floor
windows. The sashes were easily forced open,
and raised enough to enable us to insert the rubber
tubes connected with the iron reservoirs. At midnight
everything was ready.</p>

<p>I gave the word, and my assistants ran from tank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to tank, opening the stopcocks. With a hiss as of
escaping steam the huge vessels emptied themselves,
vomiting forth clouds of vapor, which, upon
contact with the air, coagulated into strange shapes
as the white of an egg does when dropped into boiling
water. The rooms became instantly filled with
dismembered shades of men and horses seeking
wildly to unite themselves with their proper parts.</p>

<p>Legs ran down the corridors, seeking their respective
trunks, arms writhed wildly reaching for
missing bodies, heads rolled hither and yon in
search of native necks. Horses' tails and hoofs
whisked and hurried in quest of equine ownership
until, reorganized, the spectral steeds galloped
about to find their riders.</p>

<p>Had it been possible, I would have stopped this
riot of wraiths long ere this, for it was more awful
than I had anticipated, but it was already too late.
Cowering in the garden, I began to hear the
screams of awakened and distracted patients. In
another moment, the front door of the hotel was
burst open, and a mob of hysterical women in expensive
nightgowns rushed out upon the lawn, and
huddled in shrieking groups.</p>

<p>I fled into the night.</p>

<p>I fled, but Napoleon's men fled with me. Compelled
by I know not what fatal astral attraction,
perhaps the subtle affinity of the creature for the
creator, the spectral shells, moved by some mysterious
mechanics of spiritual being, pursued me with
fatuous fury. I sought refuge, first, in my laboratory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
but, even as I approached, a lurid glare foretold
me of its destruction. As I drew nearer, the
whole ghost-factory was seen to be in flames; every
moment crackling reports were heard, as the over-heated
tins of phantasmagoria exploded and threw
their supernatural contents upon the night. These
liberated ghosts joined the army of Napoleon's
outraged warriors, and turned upon me. There
was not enough formaldybrom in all the world to
quench their fierce energy. There was no place in
all the world safe for me from their visitation. No
ghost-extinguisher was powerful enough to lay
the host of spirits that haunted me henceforth,
and I had neither time nor money left with which
to construct new Gatling quick-firing tanks.</p>

<p>It is little comfort to me to know that one hundred
nervous invalids were completely restored to
health by means of the terrific shock which I
administered.</p>

<p>Once 'pon a time dey was a li'l' black boy whut
he name was Mose. An' whin he come erlong to be
'bout knee-high to a mewel, he 'gin to git powerful
'fraid ob ghosts, 'ca'se dat am sure a mighty
ghostly location whut he lib' in, 'ca'se dey 's a
grabeyard in de hollow, an' a buryin'-ground on de
hill, an' a cemuntary in betwixt an' between, an'
dey ain't nuffin' but trees nowhar excipt in de
clearin' by de shanty an' down de hollow whar de
pumpkin-patch am.</p>

<p>An' whin de night come erlong, dey ain't no
sounds <i>at</i> all whut kin be heard in dat locality but
de rain-doves, whut mourn out, &ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;
jes dat trembulous <i>an'</i> scary, an' de owls, whut
mourn out, &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; more trembulous
an' scary dan dat, an' de wind, whut mourn out,
&ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; mos' scandalous' trembulous
an' scary ob all. Dat a powerful onpleasant locality
for a li'l' black boy whut he name was Mose.</p>

<p>'Ca'se dat li'l' black boy he so specially black he
can't be seen in de dark <i>at</i> all 'cept by de whites ob
he eyes. So whin he go' outen de house <i>at</i> night,
he ain't dast shut he eyes, 'ca'se den ain't nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
can see him in de least. He jes as invidsible as
nuffin'. An' who know' but whut a great, big
ghost bump right into him 'ca'se it can't see him?
An' dat shore w'u'd scare dat li'l' black boy powerful'
bad, 'ca'se yever'body knows whut a cold,
damp pussonality a ghost is.</p>

<p>So whin dat li'l' black Mose go' outen de shanty
at night, he keep' he eyes wide open, you may be
shore. By day he eyes 'bout de size ob butter-pats,
an' come sundown he eyes 'bout de size ob saucers;
but whin he go' outen de shanty at night, he eyes
am de size ob de white chiny plate whut set on de
mantel; an' it powerful' hard to keep eyes whut
am de size ob dat from a-winkin' an' a-blinkin'.</p>

<p>So whin Hallowe'en come' erlong, dat li'l' black
Mose he jes mek' up he mind he ain't gwine outen
he shack <i>at</i> all. He cogitate he gwine stay right
snug in de shack wid he pa an' he ma, 'ca'se de
rain-doves tek notice dat de ghosts are philanderin'
roun' de country, 'ca'se dey mourn out, &ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;
an' de owls dey mourn out, &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;
an' de wind mourn out, &ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;
De eyes ob dat li'l' black Mose dey as big as de
white chiny plate whut set on de mantel by side de
clock, an' de sun jes a-settin'.</p>

<p>So dat all right. Li'l' black Mose he scrooge'
back in de corner by de fireplace, an' he 'low' he
gwine stay dere till he gwine <i>to</i> bed. But byme-by
Sally Ann, whut live' up de road, draps in, an' Mistah
Sally Ann, whut is her husban', he draps in, an'
Zack Badget an' de school-teacher whut board' at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Unc' Silas Diggs's house drap in, an' a powerful
lot ob folks drap in. An' li'l' black Mose he seen
dat gwine be one s'prise-party, an' he right down
cheerful 'bout dat.</p>

<p>So all dem folks shake dere hands an' 'low
&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; an' some ob dem say: &ldquo;Why, dere's li'l'
Mose! Howdy, li'l' Mose?&rdquo; An' he so please' he
jes grin' an' grin', 'ca'se he ain't reckon whut gwine
happen. So byme-by Sally Ann, whut live up de
road, she say', &ldquo;Ain't no sort o' Hallowe'en lest we
got a jack-o'-lantern.&rdquo; An' de school-teacher,
whut board at Unc' Silas Diggs's house, she 'low',
&ldquo;Hallowe'en jes no Hallowe'en <i>at</i> all 'thout we got
a jack-o'-lantern.&rdquo; An' li'l' black Mose he stop'
a-grinnin', an' he scrooge' so far back in de corner
he 'mos' scrooge frough de wall. But dat ain't no
use, 'ca'se he ma say', &ldquo;Mose, go on down to de
pumpkin-patch an' fotch a pumpkin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't want to go,&rdquo; say' li'l' black Mose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on erlong wid yo',&rdquo; say' he ma, right
commandin'.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't want to go,&rdquo; say' Mose ag'in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why ain't yo' want to go?&rdquo; he ma ask'.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Ca'se I's afraid ob de ghosts,&rdquo; say' li'l' black
Mose, an' dat de particular truth an' no mistake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts,&rdquo; say' de school-teacher,
whut board at Unc' Silas Diggs's house, right peart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Co'se dey ain't no ghosts,&rdquo; say' Zack Badget,
whut dat 'fear'd ob ghosts he ain't dar' come to
li'l' black Mose's house ef de school-teacher ain't
ercompany him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go 'long wid your ghosts!&rdquo; say li'l' black
Mose's ma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha' yo' pick up dat nomsense?&rdquo; say' he pa.
&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' dat whut all dat s'prise-party 'low: dey
ain't no ghosts. An' dey 'low dey mus' hab a jack-o'-lantern
or de fun all sp'iled. So dat li'l' black
boy whut he name is Mose he done got to fotch a
pumpkin from de pumpkin-patch down de hollow.
So he step'outen de shanty an' he stan' on de doorstep
twell he get' he eyes pried open as big as de
bottom ob he ma's wash-tub, mostly, an' he say',
&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo; An' he put' one foot on de
ground, an' dat was de fust step.</p>

<p>An' de rain-dove say', &ldquo;OO-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he tuck anudder step.</p>

<p>An' de owl mourn' out, &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he tuck anudder step.</p>

<p>An' de wind sob' out, &ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he tuck one look ober he
shoulder, an' he shut he eyes so tight dey hurt
round de aidges, an' he pick' up he foots an' run.
Yas, sah, he run' right peart fast. An' he say':
&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts. Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo; An'
he run' erlong de paff whut lead' by de buryin'-ground
on de hill, 'ca'se dey ain't no fince eround
dat buryin'-ground <i>at</i> all.</p>

<p>No fince; jes' de big trees whut de owls an' de
rain-doves sot in an' mourn an' sob, an' whut de
wind sigh an' cry frough. An byme-by somefin'
jes' <i>brush</i>' li'l' Mose on de arm, which mek' him run
jes a bit more faster. An' byme-by somefin' jes
brush' li'l' Mose on de cheek, which mek' him run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
erbout as fast as he can. An' byme-by somefin'
grab' li'l' Mose by de aidge of he coat, an' he fight'
an' struggle' an' cry out: &ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.
Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo; An' dat ain't nuffin' but de
wild brier whut grab' him, an' dat ain't nuffin' but
de leaf ob a tree whut brush' he cheek, an' dat
ain't nuffin' but de branch ob a hazel-bush whut
brush' he arm. But he downright scared jes de
same, an' he ain't lose no time, 'ca'se de wind an' de
owls an' de rain-doves dey signerfy whut ain't no
good. So he scoot' past dat buryin'-ground whut
on de hill, an' dat cemuntary whut betwixt an' between,
an' dat grabeyard in de hollow, twell he
come' to de pumpkin-patch, an' he rotch' down
an' tek' erhold ob de bestest pumpkin whut in
de patch. An' he right smart scared. He jes'
de mostest scared li'l' black boy whut yever
was. He ain't gwine open he eyes fo' nuffin',
'ca'se de wind go, &ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de owls
go, &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de rain-doves go,
&ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He jes speculate', &ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts,&rdquo; an'
wish' he hair don't stand on ind dat way. An' he
jes cogitate', &ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts,&rdquo; an' wish' he
goose-pimples don't rise up dat way. An' he jes
'low', &ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts,&rdquo; an' wish' he backbone
ain't all trembulous wid chills dat way. So he
rotch' down, an' he rotch' down, twell he git' a good
hold on dat pricklesome stem of dat bestest pumpkin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
whut in de patch, an' he jes yank' dat stem wid
all he might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Let loosen my head!</i>&rdquo; say' a big voice all on a
suddent.</p>

<p>Dat li'l' black boy whut he name is Mose he
jump' 'most outen he skin. He open' he eyes, an'
he 'gin to shake like de aspen-tree, 'ca'se whut dat
a-standin' right dar behint him but a 'mendjous
big ghost! Yas, sah, dat de bigges', whites' ghost
whut yever was. An' it ain't got no head. Ain't
got no head <i>at</i> all! Li'l' black Mose he jes drap'
on he knees an' he beg' an' pray':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, 'scuse me! 'Scuse me, Mistah Ghost!&rdquo;
he beg'. &ldquo;Ah ain't mean no harm <i>at</i> all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whut for you try to take my head?&rdquo; ask' de
ghost in dat fearsome voice whut like de damp wind
outen de cellar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!&rdquo; beg' li'l' Mose. &ldquo;Ah
ain't know dat was yo' head, an' I ain't know you
was dar <i>at</i> all. 'Scuse me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah 'scuse you ef you do me dis favor,&rdquo; say' de
ghost. &ldquo;Ah got somefin' powerful <i>im</i>portant to
say unto you, an' Ah can't say hit 'ca'se Ah ain't
got no head; an' whin Ah ain't got no head, Ah
ain't got no mouf, an' whin Ah ain't got no mouf,
Ah can't talk <i>at</i> all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' dat right logical fo' shore. Can't nobody
talk whin he ain't got no mouf, an' can't nobody
have no mouf whin he ain't got no head, an' whin
li'l' black Mose he look', he see' dat ghost ain't got
no head <i>at</i> all. Nary head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>So de ghost say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah come on down yere fo' to git a pumpkin fo'
a head, an' Ah pick' dat <i>ixact</i> pumpkin whut yo'
gwine tek, an' Ah don't like dat one bit. No, sah.
Ah feel like Ah pick yo' up an' carry yo' away, an'
nobody see you no more for yever. But Ah got
somefin' powerful <i>im</i>portant to say unto yo', an'
if yo' pick up dat pumpkin an' sot it on de place
whar my head ought to be, Ah let you off dis time,
'ca'se Ah ain't been able to talk fo' so long Ah right
hongry to say somefin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So li'l' black Mose he heft up dat pumpkin, an'
de ghost he bend' down, an' li'l' black Mose he sot
dat pumpkin on dat ghostses neck. An' right off
dat pumpkin head 'gin' to wink an' blink like a
jack-o'-lantern, an' right off dat pumpkin head
'gin' to glimmer an' glow frough de mouf like a
jack-o'-lantern, an' right off dat ghost start' to
speak. Yas, sah, dass so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whut yo' want to say unto me?&rdquo; <i>in</i>quire' li'l'
black Mose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah want to tell yo',&rdquo; say' de ghost, &ldquo;dat yo'
ain't need yever be skeered of ghosts, 'ca'se dey
ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' whin he say dat, de ghost jes vanish' away
like de smoke in July. He ain't even linger round
dat locality like de smoke in Yoctober. He jes
dissipate' outen de air, an' he gone <i>in</i>tirely.</p>

<p>So li'l' Mose he grab' up de nex' bestest pumpkin
an' he scoot'. An' whin he come' to de grabeyard
in de hollow, he goin' erlong same as yever,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
on'y faster, whin he reckon' he'll pick up a club <i>in</i>
case he gwine have trouble. An' he rotch' down
an' rotch' down an' tek' hold of a likely appearin'
hunk o' wood whut right dar. An' whin he grab'
dat hunk of wood&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Let loosen my leg!</i>&rdquo; say' a big voice all on a
suddent.</p>

<p>Dat li'l' black boy 'most jump' outen he skin,
'ca'se right dar in de paff is six 'mendjus big ghostes
an' de bigges' ain't got but one leg. So li'l' black
Mose jes natchully handed dat hunk of wood to
dat bigges' ghost, an' he say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Scuse me, Mistah Ghost; Ah ain't know dis
your leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' whut dem six ghostes do but stand round an'
confabulate? Yas, sah, dass so. An' whin dey do
so, one say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Pears like dis a mighty likely li'l' black boy.
Whut we gwine do fo' to <i>re</i>ward him fo' politeness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' annuder say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him whut de truth is 'bout ghostes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So de bigges' ghost he say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah gwine tell yo' somefin' <i>im</i>portant whut
yever'body don't know: Dey <i>ain't</i> no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' whin he say' dat, de ghostes jes natchully
vanish away, an' li'l' black Mose he proceed' up
de paff. He so scared he hair jes yank' at de roots,
an' whin de wind go', &ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de owl
go', &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de rain-doves go,
&ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o-!&rdquo; he jes tremble' an' shake'. An'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
byme-by he come' to de cemuntary whut betwixt
an' between, an' he shore is mighty skeered, 'ca'se
dey is a whole comp'ny of ghostes lined up along
de road, an' he 'low' he ain't gwine spind no more
time palaverin' wid ghostes. So he step' offen de
road fo' to go round erbout, an' he step' on a pine-stump
whut lay right dar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Git offen my chest!</i>&rdquo; say' a big voice all on a
suddent, 'ca'se dat stump am been selected by de
captain ob de ghostes for to be he chest, 'ca'se he
ain't got no chest betwixt he shoulders an' he legs.
An' li'l' black Mose he hop' offen dat stump right
peart. Yes, <i>sah</i>; right peart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!&rdquo; dat li'l' black Mose
beg' an' plead', an' de ghostes ain't know whuther
to eat him all up or not, 'ca'se he step on de boss
ghostes's chest dat a-way. But byme-by they 'low
they let him go 'ca'se dat was an accident, an' de
captain ghost he say', &ldquo;Mose, you Mose, Ah gwine
let you off dis time, 'ca'se you ain't nuffin' but a
misabul li'l' tremblin' nigger; but Ah want you
should <i>re</i>mimimber one thing mos' particular'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ya-yas, sah,&rdquo; say' dat li'l' black boy; &ldquo;Ah'll
remimber. Whut is dat Ah got to remimber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>De captain ghost he swell' up, an' he swell' up,
twell he as big as a house, an' he say' in a voice
whut shake' de ground:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So li'l' black Mose he bound to remimber dat,
an' he rise' up an' mek' a bow, an' he proceed' toward
home right libely. He do, indeed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>An' he gwine along jes as fast as he kin, whin he
come' to de aidge ob de buryin'-ground whut on de
hill, an' right dar he bound to stop, 'ca'se de kentry
round about am so populate' he ain't able to go
frough. Yas, sah, seem' like all de ghostes in de
world habin' a conferince right dar. Seem' like all
de ghosteses whut yever was am havin' a convintion
on dat spot. An' dat li'l' black Mose so
skeered he jes fall' down on a' old log whut dar an'
screech' an' moan'. An' all on a suddent de log
up and spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Get offen me! Get offen me!</i>&rdquo; yell' dat log.</p>

<p>So li'l' black Mose he git' offen dat log, an' no
mistake.</p>

<p>An' soon as he git' offen de log, de log uprise, an'
li'l' black Mose he see' dat dat log am de king ob
all de ghostes. An' whin de king uprise, all de congergation
crowd round li'l' black Mose, an' dey
am about leben millium an' a few lift over. Yas,
sah; dat de reg'lar annyul Hallowe'en convintion
whut li'l' black Mose interrup'. Right dar am all
de sperits in de world, an' all de ha'nts in de world,
an' all de hobgoblins in de world, an' all de ghouls
in de world, an' all de spicters in de world, an' all de
ghostes in de world. An' whin dey see li'l' black
Mose, dey all gnash dey teef an' grin' 'ca'se it
gettin' erlong toward dey-all's lunch-time. So de
king, whut he name old Skull-an'-Bones, he step'
on top ob li'l' Mose's head, an' he say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gin'l'min, de convintion will come to order.
De sicretary please note who is prisint. De firs'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
business whut come' before de convintion am: whut
we gwine do to a li'l' black boy whut stip' on de
king an' maul' all ober de king an' treat' de king
dat disrespictful'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An li'l' black Mose jes moan' an' sob':</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Scuse me! 'Scuse me, Mistah King! Ah ain't
mean no harm <i>at</i> all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But nobody ain't pay no <i>at</i>tintion to him <i>at</i> all,
'ca'se yevery one lookin' at a monstrous big ha'nt
whut name Bloody Bones, whut rose up an'
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, Mistah King, an' gin'l'min <i>an</i>'
ladies,&rdquo; he say', &ldquo;dis am a right bad case ob <i>lasy
majesty</i>, 'ca'se de king been step on. Whin yivery
li'l' black boy whut choose' gwine wander round <i>at</i>
night an' stip on de king ob ghostes, it ain't no
time for to palaver, it ain't no time for to prevaricate,
it ain't no time for to cogitate, it ain't no time
do nuffin' but tell de truth, an' de whole truth, an'
nuffin' but de truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' all dem ghostes sicond de motion, an' dey
confabulate out loud erbout dat, an' de noise soun'
like de rain-doves goin', &ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de
owls goin', &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de wind goin',
&ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; So dat risolution am passed
unanermous, an' no mistake.</p>

<p>So de king ob de ghostes, whut name old Skull-an'-Bones,
he place' he hand on de head ob li'l'
black Mose, an' he hand feel like a wet rag, an' he
say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>An' one ob de hairs whut on de head of li'l' black
Mose turn' white.</p>

<p>An' de monstrous big ha'nt whut he name
Bloody Bones he lay he hand on de head ob li'l'
black Mose, an' he hand feel like a toadstool in de
cool ob de day, an' he say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' anudder ob de hairs whut on de head ob li'l'
black Mose turn' white.</p>

<p>An' a heejus sperit whut he name Moldy Pa'm
place' he hand on de head ob li'l' black Mose, an'
he hand feel like de yunner side ob a lizard, an' he
say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' anudder ob de hairs whut on de head ob li'l'
black Mose turn white <i>as</i> snow.</p>

<p>An' a perticklar bend-up hobgoblin he put' he
hand on de head ob li'l' black Mose, an' he mek'
dat same <i>re</i>mark, an' dat whole convintion ob
ghostes an' spicters an' ha'nts an' yiver'thing,
which am more 'n a millium, pass by so quick dey-all's
hands feel lak de wind whut blow outen de
cellar whin de day am hot, an' dey-all say, &ldquo;Dey
ain't no ghosts.&rdquo; Yas, sah, dey-all say dem wo'ds
so fas' it soun' like de wind whin it moan frough de
turkentine-trees whut behind de cider-priss. An'
yivery hair whut on li'l' black Mose's head turn'
white. Dat whut happen' whin a li'l' black boy
gwine meet a ghost convintion dat-a-way. Dat's
so he ain' gwine forgit to remimber dey ain't no
ghostes. 'Ca'se ef a li'l' black boy gwine imaginate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
dey <i>is</i> ghostes, he gwine be skeered in de dark. An'
dat a foolish thing for to imaginate.</p>

<p>So prisintly all de ghostes am whiff away, like
de fog outen de holler whin de wind blow' on it, an'
li'l' black Mose he ain' see no ca'se for to remain in
dat locality no longer. He rotch' down, an' he
raise' up de pumpkin, an' he perambulate' right
quick to he ma's shack, an' he lift' up de latch, an'
he open' de do', an' he yenter' in. An' he say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yere's de pumpkin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' he ma an' he pa, an' Sally Ann, whut live
up de road, an' Mistah Sally Ann, whut her husban',
an' Zack Badget, an' de school-teacher whut
board at Unc' Silas Diggs's house, an' all de powerful
lot of folks whut come to de doin's, dey all
scrooged back in de cornder ob de shack, 'ca'se
Zack Badget he been done tell a ghost-tale, an' de
rain-doves gwine, &ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' de owls am
gwine, &ldquo;Whut-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; and de wind it gwine,
&ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' yiver'body powerful skeered.
'Ca'se li'l' black Mose he come' a-fumblin' an' a-rattlin'
at de do' jes whin dat ghost-tale mos'
skeery, an' yiver'body gwine imaginate dat he a
ghost a-fumblin' an' a-rattlin' at de do'. Yas, sah.
So li'l' black Mose he turn' he white head, an' he
look' roun' an' peer' roun', an' he say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whut you all skeered fo'?&rdquo;</p>

<p>'Ca'se ef anybody skeered, he want' to be skeered
too. Dat's natural. But de school-teacher, whut
live at Unc' Silas Diggs's house, she say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fo' de lan's sake, we fought you was a ghost!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>So li'l' black Mose he sort ob sniff an' he sort ob
sneer, an' he 'low':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! dey ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Den he ma she powerful took back dat li'l' black
Mose he gwine be so uppetish an' contrydict folks
whut know 'rifmeticks an' algebricks an' gin'ral
countin' widout fingers, like de school-teacher whut
board at Unc' Silas Diggs's house knows, an' she
say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! whut you know 'bout ghosts, anner
ways?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he jes kinder stan' on one
foot, an' he jes kinder suck' he thumb, an' he jes
kinder 'low':</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know nuffin' erbout ghosts, 'ca'se dey
ain't no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he pa gwine whop him fo' tellin' a fib 'bout
dey ain' no ghosts whin yiver'body know' dey is
ghosts; but de school-teacher, whut board at Unc'
Silas Diggs's house, she tek' note de hair ob li'l'
black Mose's head am plumb white, an' she tek'
note li'l' black Mose's face am de color ob wood-ash,
so she jes retch' one arm round dat li'l' black
boy, an' she jes snuggle' him up, an' she say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honey lamb, don't you be skeered; ain' nobody
gwine hurt you. How you know dey ain't no
ghosts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he kinder lean' up 'g'inst de
school-teacher whut board at Unc' Silas Diggs's
house, an' he 'low':</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Ca'se&mdash;'ca'se&mdash;'ca'se I met de cap'n ghost, an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
I met de gin'ral ghost, an' I met de king ghost, an'
I met all de ghostes whut yiver was in de whole
worl', an' yivery ghost say' de same thing: 'Dey
ain't no ghosts.' An' if de cap'n ghost an' de
gin'ral ghost an' de king ghost an' all de ghostes in
de whole worl' don't know ef dar am ghostes, who
does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Das right; das right, honey lamb,&rdquo; say' de
school-teacher. And she say': &ldquo;I been s'picious
dey ain' no ghostes dis long whiles, an' now I know.
Ef all de ghostes say dey ain' no ghosts, dey <i>ain'</i>
no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So yiver'body 'low' dat so 'cep' Zack Badget,
whut been tellin' de ghost-tale, an' he ain' gwine
say &ldquo;Yis&rdquo; an' he ain' gwine say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; 'ca'se he
right sweet on de school-teacher; but he know
right well he done seen plinty ghostes in he day.
So he boun' to be sure fust. So he say' to li'l' black
Mose:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'T ain't likely you met up wid a monstrous big
ha'nt whut live' down de lane whut he name
Bloody Bones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas,&rdquo; say' li'l' black Mose; &ldquo;I done met up
wid him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' did old Bloody Bones done tol' you dey
ain' no ghosts?&rdquo; say Zack Badget.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yas,&rdquo; say' li'l' black Mose, &ldquo;he done tell me
perzackly dat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if <i>he</i> tol' you dey ain't no ghosts,&rdquo; say'
Zack Badget, &ldquo;I got to 'low dey ain't no ghosts,
'ca'se he ain' gwine tell no lie erbout it. I know dat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Bloody Bones ghost sence I was a piccaninny, an'
I done met up wif him a powerful lot o' times, an'
he ain't gwine tell no lie erbout it. Ef dat perticklar
ghost say' dey ain't no ghosts, dey <i>ain't</i> no
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So yiver'body say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Das right; dey ain' no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' dat mek' li'l' black Mose feel mighty good,
'ca'se he ain' lak ghostes. He reckon' he gwine be
a heap mo' comfortable in he mind sence he know'
dey ain' no ghosts, an' he reckon' he ain' gwine be
skeered of nuffin' never no more. He ain' gwine
min' de dark, an' he ain' gwine min' de rain-doves
whut go', &ldquo;Oo-<i>oo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' he ain' gwine min' de
owls whut go', &ldquo;Who-<i>whoo</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo; an' he ain'
gwine min' de wind whut go', &ldquo;You-<i>you</i>-o-o-o!&rdquo;
nor nuffin', nohow. He gwine be brave as a lion,
sence he know' fo' sure dey ain' no ghosts. So
prisintly he ma say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, time fo' a li'l' black boy whut he name is
Mose to be gwine up de ladder to de loft to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he 'low' he gwine wait a bit.
He 'low' he gwine jes wait a li'l' bit. He 'low' he
gwine be no trouble <i>at</i> all ef he jes been let wait
twell he ma she gwine up de ladder to de loft to
bed, too. So he ma she say':</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git erlong wid yo'! Whut yo' skeered ob whin
dey ain't no ghosts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An' li'l' black Mose he scrooge', and he twist',
an' he pucker' up de mouf, an' he rub' he eyes, an'
prisintly he say' right low:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain' skeered ob ghosts whut am, 'ca'se dey
ain' no ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den whut <i>am</i> yo' skeered ob?&rdquo; ask he ma.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nuffin,&rdquo; say' de li'l' black boy whut he name

<h2>The Transferred Ghost</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> FRANK R. STOCKTON</h4>


<p>The country residence of Mr. John Hinckman
was a delightful place to me, for many reasons. It
was the abode of a genial, though somewhat impulsive,
hospitality. It had broad, smooth-shaven
lawns and towering oaks and elms; there were
bosky shades at several points, and not far from
the house there was a little rill spanned by a rustic
bridge with the bark on; there were fruits and
flowers, pleasant people, chess, billiards, rides,
walks, and fishing. These were great attractions;
but none of them, nor all of them together, would
have been sufficient to hold me to the place very
long. I had been invited for the trout season, but
should, probably, have finished my visit early in
the summer had it not been that upon fair days,
when the grass was dry, and the sun was not too
hot, and there was but little wind, there strolled
beneath the lofty elms, or passed lightly through
the bosky shades, the form of my Madeline.</p>

<p>This lady was not, in very truth, my Madeline.
She had never given herself to me, nor had I, in
any way, acquired possession of her. But as I
considered her possession the only sufficient reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
for the continuance of my existence, I called her,
in my reveries, mine. It may have been that I
would not have been obliged to confine the use of
this possessive pronoun to my reveries had I confessed
the state of my feelings to the lady.</p>

<p>But this was an unusually difficult thing to do.
Not only did I dread, as almost all lovers dread,
taking the step which would in an instant put an
end to that delightful season which may be termed
the ante-interrogatory period of love, and which
might at the same time terminate all intercourse
or connection with the object of my passion; but
I was, also, dreadfully afraid of John Hinckman.
This gentleman was a good friend of mine, but it
would have required a bolder man than I was at
that time to ask him for the gift of his niece, who
was the head of his household, and, according to
his own frequent statement, the main prop of his
declining years. Had Madeline acquiesced in my
general views on the subject, I might have felt
encouraged to open the matter to Mr. Hinckman;
but, as I said before, I had never asked her whether
or not she would be mine. I thought of these
things at all hours of the day and night, particularly
the latter.</p>

<p>I was lying awake one night, in the great bed in
my spacious chamber, when, by the dim light of the
new moon, which partially filled the room, I saw
John Hinckman standing by a large chair near the
door. I was very much surprised at this for two
reasons. In the first place, my host had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
before come into my room; and, in the second
place, he had gone from home that morning, and
had not expected to return for several days. It
was for this reason that I had been able that evening
to sit much later than usual with Madeline on
the moonlit porch. The figure was certainly that
of John Hinckman in his ordinary dress, but there
was a vagueness and indistinctness about it which
presently assured me that it was a ghost. Had the
good old man been murdered? and had his spirit
come to tell me of the deed, and to confide to me
the protection of his dear&mdash;? My heart fluttered
at what I was about to think, but at this instant
the figure spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, with a countenance
that indicated anxiety, &ldquo;if Mr. Hinckman will return
to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought it well to maintain a calm exterior, and
I answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not expect him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; said he, sinking into the
chair by which he stood. &ldquo;During the two years
and a half that I have inhabited this house,
that man has never before been away for a
single night. You can't imagine the relief it gives
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as he spoke he stretched out his legs, and
leaned back in the chair. His form became less
vague, and the colors of his garments more distinct
and evident, while an expression of gratified relief
succeeded to the anxiety of his countenance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Two years and a half!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I don't
understand you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is fully that length of time,&rdquo; said the ghost,
&ldquo;since I first came here. Mine is not an ordinary
case. But before I say anything more about it,
let me ask you again if you are sure Mr. Hinckman
will not return to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am as sure of it as I can be of anything,&rdquo; I
answered. &ldquo;He left to-day for Bristol, two hundred
miles away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go on,&rdquo; said the ghost, &ldquo;for I am
glad to have the opportunity of talking to someone
who will listen to me; but if John Hinckman
should come in and catch me here, I should be
frightened out of my wits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all very strange,&rdquo; I said, greatly puzzled
by what I had heard. &ldquo;Are you the ghost of Mr.
Hinckman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a bold question, but my mind was so
full of other emotions that there seemed to be no
room for that of fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am his ghost,&rdquo; my companion replied,
&ldquo;and yet I have no right to be. And this is what
makes me so uneasy, and so much afraid of him.
It is a strange story, and, I truly believe, without
precedent. Two years and a half ago, John Hinckman
was dangerously ill in this very room. At
one time he was so far gone that he was really
believed to be dead. It was in consequence of too
precipitate a report in regard to this matter that
I was, at that time, appointed to be his ghost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Imagine my surprise and horror, sir, when, after
I had accepted the position and assumed its responsibilities,
that old man revived, became convalescent,
and eventually regained his usual health.
My situation was now one of extreme delicacy and
embarrassment. I had no power to return to my
original unembodiment, and I had no right to be
the ghost of a man who was not dead. I was advised
by my friends to quietly maintain my position,
and was assured that, as John Hinckman was
an elderly man, it could not be long before I could
rightfully assume the position for which I had
been selected. But I tell you, sir,&rdquo; he continued,
with animation, &ldquo;the old fellow seems as vigorous
as ever, and I have no idea how much longer this
annoying state of things will continue. I spend
my time trying to get out of that old man's way.
I must not leave this house, and he seems to follow
me everywhere. I tell you, sir, he haunts me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is truly a queer state of things,&rdquo; I remarked.
&ldquo;But why are you afraid of him? He
couldn't hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he couldn't,&rdquo; said the ghost. &ldquo;But
his very presence is a shock and terror to me.
Imagine, sir, how you would feel if my case were
yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not imagine such a thing at all. I simply
shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if one must be a wrongful ghost at all,&rdquo; the
apparition continued, &ldquo;it would be much pleasanter
to be the ghost of some man other than John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Hinckman. There is in him an irascibility of
temper, accompanied by a facility of invective,
which is seldom met with. And what would
happen if he were to see me, and find out, as I am
sure he would, how long and why I had inhabited
his house, I can scarcely conceive. I have seen
him in his bursts of passion; and, although he did
not hurt the people he stormed at any more than
he would hurt me, they seemed to shrink before
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this I knew to be very true. Had it not been
for this peculiarity of Mr. Hinckman, I might have
been more willing to talk to him about his niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel sorry for you,&rdquo; I said, for I really began
to have a sympathetic feeling toward this unfortunate
apparition. &ldquo;Your case is indeed a hard
one. It reminds me of those persons who have had
doubles, and I suppose a man would often be very
angry indeed when he found that there was another
being who was personating himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! the cases are not similar at all,&rdquo; said the
ghost. &ldquo;A double or <i>doppelg&auml;nger</i> lives on the
earth with a man; and, being exactly like him, he
makes all sorts of trouble, of course. It is very
different with me. I am not here to live with Mr.
Hinckman. I am here to take his place. Now, it
would make John Hinckman very angry if he knew
that. Don't you know it would?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I assented promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that he is away I can be easy for a little
while,&rdquo; continued the ghost; &ldquo;and I am so glad to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have an opportunity of talking to you. I have
frequently come into your room, and watched you
while you slept, but did not dare to speak to you
for fear that if you talked with me Mr. Hinckman
would hear you, and come into the room to know
why you were talking to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would he not hear you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said the other: &ldquo;there are times when
anyone may see me, but no one hears me except
the person to whom I address myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you wish to speak to me?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the ghost, &ldquo;I like occasionally
to talk to people, and especially to someone
like yourself, whose mind is so troubled and perturbed
that you are not likely to be frightened by
a visit from one of us. But I particularly wanted
to ask you to do me a favor. There is every probability,
so far as I can see, that John Hinckman
will live a long time, and my situation is becoming
insupportable. My great object at present is to
get myself transferred, and I think that you may,
perhaps, be of use to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Transferred!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;What do you
mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I mean,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;is this: Now
that I have started on my career I have got to be
the ghost of somebody, and I want to be the ghost
of a man who is really dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think that would be easy enough,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;Opportunities must continually occur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! not at all!&rdquo; said my companion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
quickly. &ldquo;You have no idea what a rush and
pressure there is for situations of this kind. Whenever
a vacancy occurs, if I may express myself in
that way, there are crowds of applications for the
ghost-ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no idea that such a state of things
existed,&rdquo; I said, becoming quite interested in the
matter. &ldquo;There ought to be some regular system,
or order of precedence, by which you could all take
your turns like customers in a barber's shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, that would never do at all!&rdquo; said the
other. &ldquo;Some of us would have to wait forever.
There is always a great rush whenever a good
ghost-ship offers itself&mdash;while, as you know, there
are some positions that no one would care for.
And it was in consequence of my being in too great
a hurry on an occasion of the kind that I got myself
into my present disagreeable predicament, and
I have thought that it might be possible that you
would help me out of it. You might know of a case
where an opportunity for a ghost-ship was not
generally expected, but which might present itself
at any moment. If you would give me a short
notice, I know I could arrange for a transfer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you
want me to commit suicide? Or to undertake a
murder for your benefit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, no!&rdquo; said the other, with a vapory
smile. &ldquo;I mean nothing of that kind. To be sure,
there are lovers who are watched with considerable
interest, such persons having been known, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
moments of depression, to offer very desirable
ghost-ships; but I did not think of anything of
that kind in connection with you. You were the
only person I cared to speak to, and I hoped that
you might give me some information that would
be of use; and, in return, I shall be very glad to
help you in your love affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to know that I have such an affair,&rdquo;
I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; replied the other, with a little yawn.
&ldquo;I could not be here so much as I have been without
knowing all about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something horrible in the idea of
Madeline and myself having been watched by a
ghost, even, perhaps, when we wandered together
in the most delightful and bosky places. But,
then, this was quite an exceptional ghost, and I
could not have the objections to him which would
ordinarily arise in regard to beings of his class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; said the ghost, rising: &ldquo;but I
will see you somewhere to-morrow night. And remember&mdash;you
help me, and I'll help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had doubts the next morning as to the propriety
of telling Madeline anything about this
interview, and soon convinced myself that I must
keep silent on the subject. If she knew there was
a ghost about the house, she would probably leave
the place instantly. I did not mention the matter,
and so regulated my demeanor that I am quite
sure Madeline never suspected what had taken
place. For some time I had wished that Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Hinckman would absent himself, for a day at least,
from the premises. In such case I thought I might
more easily nerve myself up to the point of speaking
to Madeline on the subject of our future collateral
existence; and, now that the opportunity
for such speech had really occurred, I did not feel
ready to avail myself of it. What would become
of me if she refused me?</p>

<p>I had an idea, however, that the lady thought
that, if I were going to speak at all, this was the
time. She must have known that certain sentiments
were afloat within me, and she was not unreasonable
in her wish to see the matter settled one
way or the other. But I did not feel like taking a
bold step in the dark. If she wished me to ask
her to give herself to me, she ought to offer me some
reason to suppose that she would make the gift.
If I saw no probability of such generosity, I would
prefer that things should remain as they were.</p>

<br />

<p>That evening I was sitting with Madeline in the
moonlit porch. It was nearly ten o'clock, and ever
since supper-time I had been working myself up to
the point of making an avowal of my sentiments.
I had not positively determined to do this, but
wished gradually to reach the proper point, when,
if the prospect looked bright, I might speak. My
companion appeared to understand the situation&mdash;at
least, I imagined that the nearer I came to a
proposal the more she seemed to expect it. It was
certainly a very critical and important epoch in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
my life. If I spoke, I should make myself happy or
miserable forever, and if I did not speak I had
every reason to believe that the lady would not
give me another chance to do so.</p>

<p>Sitting thus with Madeline, talking a little, and
thinking very hard over these momentous matters,
I looked up and saw the ghost, not a dozen feet
away from us. He was sitting on the railing of the
porch, one leg thrown up before him, the other
dangling down as he leaned against a post. He was
behind Madeline, but almost in front of me, as I
sat facing the lady. It was fortunate that Madeline
was looking out over the landscape, for I must
have appeared very much startled. The ghost had
told me that he would see me some time this night,
but I did not think he would make his appearance
when I was in the company of Madeline. If she
should see the spirit of her uncle, I could not
answer for the consequences. I made no exclamation,
but the ghost evidently saw that I was
troubled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be afraid,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I shall not let her
see me; and she cannot hear me speak unless I address
myself to her, which I do not intend to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I suppose I looked grateful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you need not trouble yourself about that,&rdquo;
the ghost continued; &ldquo;but it seems to me that you
are not getting along very well with your affair.
If I were you, I should speak out without waiting
any longer. You will never have a better chance.
You are not likely to be interrupted; and, so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as I can judge, the lady seems disposed to listen to
you favorably; that is, if she ever intends to do so.
There is no knowing when John Hinckman will go
away again; certainly not this summer. If I were
in your place, I should never dare to make love to
Hinckman's niece if he were anywhere about the
place. If he should catch anyone offering himself
to Miss Madeline, he would then be a terrible man
to encounter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I agreed perfectly to all this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot bear to think of him!&rdquo; I ejaculated
aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of whom?&rdquo; asked Madeline, turning
quickly toward me.</p>

<p>Here was an awkward situation. The long
speech of the ghost, to which Madeline paid no
attention, but which I heard with perfect distinctness,
had made me forget myself.</p>

<p>It was necessary to explain quickly. Of course,
it would not do to admit that it was of her dear
uncle that I was speaking; and so I mentioned
hastily the first name I thought of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vilars,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>This statement was entirely correct; for I never
could bear to think of Mr. Vilars, who was a gentleman
who had, at various times, paid much attention
to Madeline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is wrong for you to speak in that way of Mr.
Vilars,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is a remarkably well educated
and sensible young man, and has very
pleasant manners. He expects to be elected to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
legislature this fall, and I should not be surprised if
he made his mark. He will do well in a legislative
body, for whenever Mr. Vilars has anything to
say he knows just how and when to say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was spoken very quietly, and without any
show of resentment, which was all very natural,
for if Madeline thought at all favorably of me she
could not feel displeased that I should have disagreeable
emotions in regard to a possible rival.
The concluding words contained a hint which I
was not slow to understand. I felt very sure that
if Mr. Vilars were in my present position he would
speak quickly enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is wrong to have such ideas about a
person,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I cannot help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lady did not chide me, and after this she
seemed even in a softer mood. As for me, I felt
considerably annoyed, for I had not wished to
admit that any thought of Mr. Vilars had ever
occupied my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not speak aloud that way,&rdquo; said
the ghost, &ldquo;or you may get yourself into trouble.
I want to see everything go well with you, because
then you may be disposed to help me, especially if
I should chance to be of any assistance to you,
which I hope I shall be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I longed to tell him that there was no way in
which he could help me so much as by taking his
instant departure. To make love to a young lady
with a ghost sitting on the railing nearby, and that
ghost the apparition of a much-dreaded uncle, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
very idea of whom in such a position and at such a
time made me tremble, was a difficult, if not an
impossible, thing to do; but I forbore to speak,
although I may have looked my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; continued the ghost, &ldquo;that you
have not heard anything that might be of advantage
to me. Of course, I am very anxious to hear;
but if you have anything to tell me, I can wait
until you are alone. I will come to you to-night
in your room, or I will stay here until the lady goes
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not wait here,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I have nothing
at all to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madeline sprang to her feet, her face flushed and
her eyes ablaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What do you suppose
I am waiting for? Nothing to say to me indeed!&mdash;I
should think so! What should you have to say
to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madeline!&rdquo; I exclaimed, stepping toward her,
&ldquo;let me explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she had gone.</p>

<p>Here was the end of the world for me! I turned
fiercely to the ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wretched existence!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;You have
ruined everything. You have blackened my whole
life. Had it not been for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here my voice faltered. I could say no
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrong me,&rdquo; said the ghost. &ldquo;I have not
injured you. I have tried only to encourage and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
assist you, and it is your own folly that has done
this mischief. But do not despair. Such mistakes
as these can be explained. Keep up a brave heart.
Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he vanished from the railing like a bursting
soap-bubble.</p>

<p>I went gloomily to bed, but I saw no apparitions
that night except those of despair and misery which
my wretched thoughts called up. The words I had
uttered had sounded to Madeline like the basest
insult. Of course, there was only one interpretation
she could put upon them.</p>

<p>As to explaining my ejaculations, that was impossible.
I thought the matter over and over again
as I lay awake that night, and I determined that I
would never tell Madeline the facts of the case. It
would be better for me to suffer all my life than for
her to know that the ghost of her uncle haunted
the house. Mr. Hinckman was away, and if she
knew of his ghost she could not be made to believe
that he was not dead. She might not survive the
shock! No, my heart could bleed, but I would
never tell her.</p>

<p>The next day was fine, neither too cool nor too
warm; the breezes were gentle, and nature smiled.
But there were no walks or rides with Madeline.
She seemed to be much engaged during the day,
and I saw but little of her. When we met at meals
she was polite, but very quiet and reserved. She
had evidently determined on a course of conduct
and had resolved to assume that, although I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
been very rude to her, she did not understand the
import of my words. It would be quite proper, of
course, for her not to know what I meant by my
expressions of the night before.</p>

<p>I was downcast and wretched, and said but little,
and the only bright streak across the black horizon
of my woe was the fact that she did not appear to
be happy, although she affected an air of unconcern.
The moonlit porch was deserted that
evening, but wandering about the house I found
Madeline in the library alone. She was reading,
but I went in and sat down near her. I felt that,
although I could not do so fully, I must in a measure
explain my conduct of the night before. She
listened quietly to a somewhat labored apology
I made for the words I had used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not the slightest idea what you meant,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but you were very rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I earnestly disclaimed any intention of rudeness,
and assured her, with a warmth of speech that
must have made some impression upon her, that
rudeness to her would be an action impossible to
me. I said a great deal upon the subject, and implored
her to believe that if it were not for a certain
obstacle I could speak to her so plainly that she
would understand everything.</p>

<p>She was silent for a time, and then she said,
rather more kindly, I thought, than she had spoken
before:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that obstacle in any way connected with my
uncle?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, after a little hesitation, &ldquo;it
is, in a measure, connected with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no answer to this, and sat looking at
her book, but not reading. From the expression
of her face, I thought she was somewhat softened
toward me. She knew her uncle as well as I did,
and she may have been thinking that, if he were
the obstacle that prevented my speaking (and
there were many ways in which he might be that
obstacle), my position would be such a hard one
that it would excuse some wildness of speech and
eccentricity of manner. I saw, too, that the
warmth of my partial explanations had had some
effect on her, and I began to believe that it might
be a good thing for me to speak my mind without
delay. No matter how she should receive my proposition,
my relations with her could not be worse
than they had been the previous night and day,
and there was something in her face which encouraged
me to hope that she might forget my
foolish exclamations of the evening before if I
began to tell her my tale of love.</p>

<p>I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and as I
did so the ghost burst into the room from the doorway
behind her. I say burst, although no door
flew open and he made no noise. He was wildly
excited, and waved his arms above his head. The
moment I saw him, my heart fell within me. With
the entrance of that impertinent apparition, every
hope fled from me. I could not speak while he was
in the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>I must have turned pale; and I gazed steadfastly
at the ghost, almost without seeing Madeline, who
sat between us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that John Hinckman
is coming up the hill? He will be here in
fifteen minutes; and if you are doing anything in
the way of love-making, you had better hurry it
up. But this is not what I came to tell you. I
have glorious news! At last I am transferred! Not
forty minutes ago a Russian nobleman was murdered
by the Nihilists. Nobody ever thought of
him in connection with an immediate ghost-ship.
My friends instantly applied for the situation for
me, and obtained my transfer. I am off before
that horrid Hinckman comes up the hill. The
moment I reach my new position, I shall put off
this hated semblance. Good-by. You can't imagine
how glad I am to be, at last, the real ghost of
somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I cried, rising to my feet, and stretching
out my arms in utter wretchedness, &ldquo;I would to
Heaven you were mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> yours,&rdquo; said Madeline, raising to me her
tearful eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> TH&Eacute;OPHILE GAUTIER</h4>


<p>I had sauntered idly into the shop of one of those
dealers in old curiosities&mdash;&ldquo;bric-&agrave;-brac&rdquo; as they
say in that Parisian <i>argot</i>, so absolutely unintelligible
elsewhere in France.</p>

<p>You have no doubt often glanced through the
windows of some of these shops, which have become
numerous since it is so fashionable to buy
antique furniture, that the humblest stockbroker
feels obliged to have a room furnished in medieval
style.</p>

<p>Something is there which belongs alike to the
shop of the dealer in old iron, the warehouse of
the merchant, the laboratory of the chemist, and
the studio of the painter: in all these mysterious
recesses, where but a discreet half-light filters
through the shutters, the most obviously antique
thing is the dust: the cobwebs are more genuine
than the laces, and the old pear-tree furniture is
more modern than the mahogany which arrived
but yesterday from America.</p>

<p>The warehouse of my dealer in bric-&agrave;-brac was a
veritable Capharna&uuml;m; all ages and all countries
seemed to have arranged a rendezvous there; an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Etruscan terra cotta lamp stood upon a Boule
cabinet, with ebony panels decorated with simple
filaments of inlaid copper: a duchess of the reign of
Louis XV stretched nonchalantly her graceful
feet under a massive Louis XIII table with heavy,
spiral oaken legs, and carvings of intermingled
flowers and grotesque figures.</p>

<p>In a corner glittered the ornamented breastplate
of a suit of damaskeened armor of Milan. The
shelves and floor were littered with porcelain cupids
and nymphs, Chinese monkeys, vases of pale green
enamel, cups of Dresden and old S&egrave;vres.</p>

<p>Upon the denticulated shelves of sideboards,
gleamed huge Japanese plaques, with red and blue
designs outlined in gold, side by side with the
enamels of Bernard Palissy, with serpents, frogs,
and lizards in relief.</p>

<p>From ransacked cabinets tumbled cascades of
silvery-gleaming China silk, the shimmering brocade
pricked into luminous beads by a slanting
sunbeam; while portraits of every epoch smiled
through their yellowed varnish from frames more
or less tarnished.</p>

<p>The dealer followed me watchfully through the
tortuous passages winding between the piles of
furniture, warding off with his hands the perilous
swing of my coat tail, observing my elbows with
the disquieting concern of an antiquarian and a
usurer.</p>

<p>He was an odd figure&mdash;this dealer; an enormous
skull, smooth as a knee, was surrounded by a scant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
aureole of white hair, which, by contrast, emphasized
the salmon-colored tint of his complexion,
and gave a wrong impression of patriarchal benevolence,
corrected, however, by the glittering of
two small, yellow eyes which shifted in their orbits
like two <i>louis d'or</i> floating on quicksilver. The
curve of his nose gave him an aquiline silhouette,
which suggested the Oriental or Jewish type. His
hands, long, slender, with prominent veins and
sinews protruding like the strings on a violin, with
nails like the claws on the membraneous wings of
the bat moved with a senile trembling painful to
behold, but those nervously quivering hands became
firmer than pincers of steel, or the claws of a
lobster, when they picked up any precious object,
an onyx cup, a Venetian glass, or a platter of Bohemian
crystal. This curious old fellow had an
air so thoroughly rabbinical and cabalistic, that,
from mere appearance, he would have been burned
at the stake three centuries ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not buy something from me to-day,
sir? Here is a kris from Malay, with a blade which
undulates like a flame; look at these grooves for
the blood to drip from, these teeth reversed so as
to tear out the entrails in withdrawing the weapon;
it is a fine specimen of a ferocious weapon, and will
be an interesting addition to your trophies; this
two-handed sword is very beautiful&mdash;it is the
work of Joseph de la Herz; and this <i>cauchelimarde</i>
with its carved guard&mdash;what superb workmanship!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&ldquo;No, I have enough weapons and instruments of
carnage; I should like to have a small figure, any
sort of object which can be used for a paper weight;
for I cannot endure those commonplace bronzes
for sale at the stationers which one sees invariably
on everybody's desk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gnome, rummaging among his ancient
wares, displayed before me some antique bronzes&mdash;pseudo-antique,
at least, fragments of malachite,
little Hindu and Chinese idols, jade monkeys, incarnations
of Brahma and Vishnu, marvelously
suitable for the purpose&mdash;scarcely divine&mdash;of
holding papers and letters in place.</p>

<p>I was hesitating between a porcelain dragon
covered with constellations of warts, its jaws embellished
with teeth and tusks, and a hideous little
Mexican fetish, representing realistically the god
Vitziliputzili, when I noticed a charming foot,
which at first I supposed was a fragment of some
antique Venus.</p>

<p>It had that beautiful tawny reddish tint, which
gives the Florentine bronzes their warm, life-like
appearance, so preferable to the verdigris tones of
ordinary bronzes, which might be taken readily for
statues in a state of putrefaction; a satiny luster
gleamed over its curves, polished by the amorous
kisses of twenty centuries; for it must have been a
Corinthian bronze, a work of the finest period,
molded perhaps by Lysippus himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That foot will do,&rdquo; I said to the dealer, who
looked at me with an ironical, crafty expression, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
he handed me the object I asked for, so that I
might examine it more carefully.</p>

<p>I was surprised at its lightness. It was not a
metal foot but in reality a foot of flesh, an embalmed
foot, a mummy's foot; on examining it
more closely, one could distinguish the grain of the
skin, and the almost imperceptible imprint of the
weave of the wrappings. The toes were slender,
delicate, with perfect nails, pure and transparent
as agate; the great toe, slightly separated from the
others, in the antique manner was in pleasing contrast
to the position of the other toes, and gave a
suggestion of the freedom and lightness of a bird's
foot. The sole, faintly streaked with almost invisible
lines, showed that it had never touched the
ground, or come in contact with anything but the
finest mats woven from the rushes of the Nile, and
the softest rugs of panther skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! You want the foot of the Princess
Hermonthis,&rdquo; said the dealer with a strange,
mocking laugh, staring at me with his owlish eyes.
&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha, for a paper weight! An original idea!
an artist's idea! If anyone had told old Pharaoh
that the foot of his adored daughter would be used
for a paper weight, particularly whilst he was
having a mountain of granite hollowed out in which
to place her triple coffin, painted and gilded,
covered with hieroglyphics, and beautiful pictures
of the judgment of souls, it would truly have surprised
him,&rdquo; continued the queer little dealer, in
low tones, as though talking to himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&ldquo;How much will you charge me for this fragment
of a mummy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, as much as I can get; for it is a superb
piece; if I had the mate to it, you could not have
it for less than five hundred francs&mdash;the daughter
of a Pharaoh! there could be nothing more choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assuredly it is not common; but, still, how
much do you want for it? First, however, I want
to acquaint you with one fact, which is, that my
fortune consists of only five louis. I will buy anything
that costs five louis, but nothing more expensive.
You may search my vest pockets, and
my most secret bureau drawers, but you will not
find one miserable five franc piece besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five louis for the foot of the Princess Hermonthis!
It is very little, too little, in fact, for an
authentic foot,&rdquo; said the dealer, shaking his head
and rolling his eyes with a peculiar rotary motion.
&ldquo;Very well, take it, and I will throw in the outer
covering,&rdquo; he said, rolling it in a shred of old
damask&mdash;&ldquo;very beautiful, genuine damask, which
has never been redyed; it is strong, yet it is soft,&rdquo;
he muttered, caressing the frayed tissue, in accordance
with his dealer's habit of praising an article
of so little value, that he himself thought it good
for nothing but to give away.</p>

<p>He dropped the gold pieces into a kind of medieval
pouch which was fastened at his belt, while he
repeated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The foot of the Princess Hermonthis to be used
for a paper weight!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Then, fastening upon me his phosphorescent
pupils he said, in a voice strident as the wails of a
cat which has just swallowed a fish bone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Pharaoh will not be pleased; he loved his
daughter&mdash;that dear man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak of him as though you were his contemporary;
no matter how old you may be, you
do not date back to the pyramids of Egypt,&rdquo; I
answered laughingly from the threshold of the
shop.</p>

<p>I returned home, delighted with my purchase.</p>

<p>To make use of it at once, I placed the foot of the
exalted Princess Hermonthis on a stack of papers&mdash;sketches
of verses, undecipherable mosaics of
crossed out words, unfinished articles, forgotten
letters, posted in the desk drawer, a mistake often
made by absent-minded people; the effect was
pleasing, bizarre, and romantic.</p>

<p>Highly delighted with this decoration, I went
down into the street, and took a walk with all the
importance and pride proper to a man who has the
inexpressible advantage over the passersby he
elbows, of possessing a fragment of the Princess
Hermonthis, daughter of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>I thought people who did not possess, like myself,
a paper weight so genuinely Egyptian, were
objects of ridicule, and it seemed to me the proper
business of the sensible man to have a mummy's
foot upon his desk.</p>

<p>Happily, an encounter with several friends distracted
me from my raptures over my recent acquisition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
I went to dinner with them, for it would
have been hard for me to dine alone.</p>

<p>When I returned at night, with my brain somewhat
muddled by the effects of a few glasses of
wine, a vague whiff of oriental perfume tickled
delicately my olfactory nerves. The heat of the
room had warmed the natron, the bitumen, and
the myrrh in which the <i>paraschites</i> who embalmed
the dead had bathed the body of the Princess; it
was a delicate, yet penetrating perfume, which four
thousand years had not been able to dissipate.</p>

<p>The Dream of Egypt was for the Eternal; its
odors have the solidity of granite, and last as long.</p>

<p>In a short time I drank full draughts from the
black cup of sleep; for an hour or two all remained
in obscurity; Oblivion and Nothingness submerged
me in their somber waves.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the haziness of my perceptions
gradually cleared away, dreams began to brush me
lightly in their silent flight.</p>

<p>The eyes of my soul opened, and I saw my room
as it was in reality. I might have believed myself
awake, if I had not had a vague consciousness that
I was asleep, and that something very unusual was
about to take place.</p>

<p>The odor of myrrh had increased in intensity,
and I had a slight headache, which I very naturally
attributed to several glasses of champagne that
we had drunk to unknown gods, and to our future
success.</p>

<p>I scrutinized my room with a feeling of expectation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which there was nothing to justify. Each
piece of furniture was in its usual place; the lamp,
softly shaded by the milky whiteness of its ground
crystal globe, burned upon the console, the water
colors glowed from under the Bohemian glass;
the curtains hung in heavy drooping folds; everything
suggested tranquility and slumber.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after a few moments the quiet of
the room was disturbed, the woodwork creaked
furtively, the ash-covered log suddenly spurted
out a blue flame, and the surfaces of the plaques
seemed like metallic eyes, watching, like myself, for
what was about to happen.</p>

<p>By chance my eyes fell on the table on which I
had placed the foot of the Princess Hermonthis.</p>

<p>Instead of remaining in the state of immobility
proper to a foot which has been embalmed for four
thousand years, it moved about in an agitated
manner, twitching, leaping about over the papers
like a frightened frog; one might have thought it in
contact with a galvanic battery; I could hear distinctly
the quick tap of the little heel, hard as the
hoof of a gazelle.</p>

<p>I became rather dissatisfied with my purchase,
for I like paper weights of sedentary habits&mdash;besides
I found it very unnatural for feet to move
about without legs, and I began to feel something
closely resembling fear.</p>

<p>Suddenly I noticed a movement of one of the
folds of my curtains, and I heard a stamping like
that made by a person hopping about on one foot.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I must admit that I grew hot and cold by turns,
that I felt a mysterious breeze blowing down my
back, and that my hair stood on end so suddenly
that it forced my night-cap to a leap of several
degrees.</p>

<p>The curtains partly opened, and I saw the
strangest figure possible advancing.</p>

<p>It was a young girl, as coffee-coloured as Amani
the dancer, and of a perfect beauty of the purest
Egyptian type. She had slanting almond-shaped
eyes, with eyebrows so black that they appeared
blue; her nose was finely chiseled, almost Grecian
in its delicacy; she might have been taken for a
Corinthian statue of bronze, had not her prominent
cheekbones and rather African fullness of lips
indicated without a doubt the hieroglyphic race
which dwelt on the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p>Her arms, thin, spindle shaped, like those of very
young girls, were encircled with a kind of metal
ornament, and bracelets of glass beads; her hair
was twisted into little cords; on her breast hung a
green paste idol, identified by her whip of seven
lashes as Isis, guide of souls&mdash;a golden ornament
shone on her forehead, and slight traces of rouge
were visible on the coppery tints of her cheeks.</p>

<p>As for her costume, it was very odd.</p>

<p>Imagine a <i>pagne</i> made of narrow strips bedizened
with red and black hieroglyphics, weighted
with bitumen, and apparently belonging to a
mummy newly unswathed.</p>

<p>In one of those flights of fancy usual in dreams,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
I could hear the hoarse, rough voice of the dealer
of bric-&agrave;-brac reciting in a monotonous refrain, the
phrase he had kept repeating in his shop in so
enigmatic a manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Pharaoh will not be pleased&mdash;he loved his
daughter very much&mdash;that dear man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One peculiar detail, which was hardly reassuring,
was that the apparition had but one foot, the other
was broken off at the ankle.</p>

<p>She approached the table, where the mummy's
foot was fidgeting and tossing about with redoubled
energy. She leaned against the edge, and I saw
her eyes fill with pearly tears.</p>

<p>Although she did not speak, I fully understood
her feelings. She looked at the foot, for it was in
truth her own, with an expression of coquettish
sadness, which was extremely charming; but the
foot kept jumping and running about as though
it were moved by springs of steel.</p>

<p>Two or three times she stretched out her hand to
grasp it, but did not succeed.</p>

<p>Then began between the Princess Hermonthis
and her foot, which seemed to be endowed with an
individuality of its own, a very bizarre dialogue, in
an ancient Coptic tongue, such as might have been
spoken thirty centuries before, among the sphinxes
of the Land of Ser; fortunately, that night I understood
Coptic perfectly.</p>

<p>The Princess Hermonthis said in a tone of voice
sweet and tremulous as the tones of a crystal
bell:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>&ldquo;Well, my dear little foot, you always flee from
me, yet I took the best of care of you; I bathed you
with perfumed water, in a basin of alabaster; I
rubbed your heel with pumice stone, mixed with
oil of palm; your nails were cut with golden scissors,
and polished with a hippopotamus' tooth; I was
careful to select for you painted and embroidered
<i>tatbebs</i>, with turned up toes, which were the
envy of all the young girls of Egypt; on your great
toe, you wore rings representing the sacred Scarab,
and you supported one of the lightest bodies that
could be desired by a lazy foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The foot answered in a pouting, regretful voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know well that I no longer belong to myself.
I have been bought and paid for; the old
dealer knew what he was about. He bears you a
grudge for having refused to marry him. This is a
trick he has played on you. The Arab who forced
open your royal tomb, in the subterranean pits of
the Necropolis of Thebes, was sent there by him.
He wanted to prevent you from attending the reunion
of the shades, in the cities of the lower world.
Have you five pieces of gold with which to ransom
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, no! My jewels, my rings, my purses of
gold and of silver have all been stolen from me,&rdquo;
answered the Princess Hermonthis with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; I then cried out, &ldquo;I have never kept
possession of anyone's foot unjustly; even though
you have not the five louis which it cost me, I will
return it to you gladly; I should be wretched, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
I the cause of the lameness of so charming a person
as the Princess Hermonthis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I delivered this discourse in a courtly, troubadour-like
manner, which must have astonished the
beautiful Egyptian.</p>

<p>She looked at me with an expression of deepest
gratitude, and her eyes brightened with bluish
lights.</p>

<p>She took her foot, which this time submitted,
and, like a woman about to put on her brodekin,
she adjusted it to her leg with great dexterity.</p>

<p>This operation finished, she took a few steps
about the room, as though to assure herself that
she was in reality no longer lame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, how happy my father will be, he who was
so wretched because of my mutilation&mdash;he who,
from the day of my birth, set a whole nation to
work to hollow out a tomb so deep that he might
preserve me intact until that supreme last day,
when souls must be weighed in the scales of Amenti!
Come with me to my father; he will be happy to
receive you, for you have given me back my foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I found this proposition quite natural. I decked
myself out in a dressing-gown of huge sprawling
design, which gave me an extremely Pharaohesque
appearance; I hurriedly put on a pair of Turkish
slippers, and told the Princess Hermonthis that I
was ready to follow her.</p>

<p>Before setting out, Hermonthis detached from
her necklace the little green paste image and placed
it on the scattered papers which strewed the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>&ldquo;It is no more than right,&rdquo; she said smilingly,
&ldquo;that I should replace your paper weight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me her hand, which was soft and cool
as the skin of a serpent, and we departed.</p>

<p>For a time we sped with the rapidity of an arrow,
through a misty expanse of space, in which almost
indistinguishable silhouettes flashed by us, on the
right and left.</p>

<p>For an instant we saw nothing but sea and sky.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, towering obelisks, pillars,
the sloping outlines of the sphinx, were designed
against the horizon.</p>

<p>We had arrived.</p>

<p>The princess conducted me to the side of a mountain
of red granite in which there was an aperture
so low and narrow that, had it not been marked by
two monoliths covered with bizarre carvings, it
would have been difficult to distinguish from the
fissures in the rock.</p>

<p>Hermonthis lighted a torch and led the way.</p>

<p>The corridors were hewn through the living rock.
The walls, with panels covered with hieroglyphics,
and representations of allegorical processions, must
have been the work of thousands of hands for
thousands of years; the corridors, of an interminable
length, ended in square rooms, in the middle
of which pits had been constructed, to which we
descended by means of <i>crampons</i> or spiral staircases.
These pits led us into other rooms, from
which opened out other corridors embellished in
the same bizarre manner with sparrow-hawks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
serpents coiled in circles, the symbolic tau, pedum,
and baris, prodigious works which no living eye
should ever see, interminable legends in granite
which only the dead throughout eternity have
time to read.</p>

<p>At last we reached a hall so vast, so boundless, so
immeasurable, that its limits could not be discerned.
As far as the eye could see, extended files
of gigantic columns, between which sparkled livid
stars of yellow light. These glittering points of
light revealed incalculable depths beyond.</p>

<p>The Princess Hermonthis, still holding my hand,
greeted graciously the mummies of her acquaintance.</p>

<p>My eyes gradually became accustomed to the
shadowy twilight, and I began to distinguish the
objects around me.</p>

<p>I saw, seated upon their thrones, the kings of the
subterranean races. They were dignified old personages,
or dried up, shriveled, wrinkled-like parchment,
and blackened with naphtha and bitumen.
On their heads they wore pschents of gold, and
their breastplates and gorgets scintillated with
precious stones; their eyes had the fixedness of
the sphinx, and their long beards were whitened by
the snows of centuries. Behind them stood their
embalmed subjects, in the rigid and constrained
postures of Egyptian art, preserving eternally the
attitudes prescribed by the hieratic code. Behind
the subjects, the cats, ibixes, and crocodiles contemporary
with them, rendered still more monstrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
by their wrappings, mewed, beat their wings,
and opened and closed their huge jaws in foolish
grimaces.</p>

<p>All the Pharaohs were there&mdash;Cheops, Chephrenes,
Psammetichus, Sesostri, Amenoteph, all the
dark-skinned rulers of the country of the pyramids,
and the royal sepulchers; on a still higher platform
sat enthroned the kings Chronos, and Xixouthros,
who were contemporary with the deluge, and Tubal-Cain,
who preceded it.</p>

<p>The beard of King Xixouthros had grown to such
lengths that it had already wound itself seven
times around the granite table against which he
leaned, lost in reverie, as though in slumber.</p>

<p>Further in the distance, through a dim exhalation,
across the mists of eternities, I beheld vaguely
the seventy-two pre-Adamite kings, with their
seventy-two peoples, vanished forever.</p>

<p>The Princess Hermonthis, after allowing me a
few moments to enjoy this dizzying spectacle, presented
me to Pharaoh, her father, who nodded to
me in a most majestic manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have found my foot&mdash;I have found my foot!&rdquo;
cried the Princess, clapping her little hands, with
every indication of uncontrollable joy. &ldquo;It was
this gentleman who returned it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The races of Kheme, the races of Nahasi, all the
races, black, bronze, and copper-colored, repeated
in a chorus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Princess Hermonthis has found her foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Xixouthros himself was deeply affected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>He raised his heavy eyelids, stroked his moustache,
and regarded me with his glance charged
with the centuries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Oms, the dog of Hell, and by Tmei, daughter
of the Sun and of Truth, here is a brave and
worthy young man,&rdquo; said Pharaoh, extending
toward me his scepter which terminated in a lotus
flower. &ldquo;What recompense do you desire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eagerly, with that audacity which one has in
dreams, where nothing seems impossible, I asked
him for the hand of the Princess Hermonthis. Her
hand in exchange for her foot, seemed to me an
antithetical recompense, in sufficiently good taste.</p>

<p>Pharaoh opened wide his eyes of glass, surprised
at my pleasantry, as well as my request.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what country are you, and what is your
age?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Frenchman, and I am twenty-seven
years old, venerable Pharaoh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-seven years old! And he wishes to
espouse the Princess Hermonthis, who is thirty
centuries old!&rdquo; exclaimed in a chorus all the
thrones, and all the circles of nations.</p>

<p>Hermonthis alone did not seem to think my request
improper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were even two thousand years old,&rdquo;
continued the old king, &ldquo;I would gladly bestow
upon you the Princess; but the disproportion is too
great; besides, our daughters must have husbands
who will last, and you no longer know how to preserve
yourselves. Of the last persons who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
brought here, scarcely fifteen centuries ago, nothing
now remains but a pinch of ashes. Look! my
flesh is as hard as basalt, my bones are bars of
steel. I shall be present on the last day, with the
body and features I had in life. My daughter
Hermonthis will last longer than a statue of bronze.
But at that time the winds will have dissipated the
last grains of your dust, and Isis herself, who knew
how to recover the fragments of Osiris, would
hardly be able to recompose your being. See how
vigorous I still am, and how powerful is the
strength of my arm,&rdquo; said he, shaking my hand in
the English fashion, in a way that cut my fingers
with my rings.</p>

<p>His grasp was so strong that I awoke, and discovered
my friend Alfred, who was pulling me by
the arm, and shaking me, to make me get up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, see here, you maddening sleeper! Must I
have you dragged into the middle of the street, and
have fireworks put off close to your ear, in order
to waken you? It is afternoon. Don't you remember
that you promised to call for me and take
me to see the Spanish pictures of M. Aguada?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! I forgot all about it,&rdquo; I answered,
dressing hurriedly. &ldquo;We can go there at
once&mdash;I have the permit here on my table.&rdquo; I
crossed over to get it; imagine my astonishment
when I saw, not the mummy's foot I had bought
the evening before, but the little green paste image
left in its place by the Princess Hermonthis!</p>

<h2>The Rival Ghosts</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By BRANDER MATTHEWS</span></h4>


<p>The good ship sped on her way across the calm
Atlantic. It was an outward passage, according to
the little charts which the company had charily
distributed, but most of the passengers were homeward
bound, after a summer of rest and recreation,
and they were counting the days before they might
hope to see Fire Island Light. On the lee side of
the boat, comfortably sheltered from the wind,
and just by the door of the captain's room (which
was theirs during the day), sat a little group of
returning Americans. The Duchess (she was down
on the purser's list as Mrs. Martin, but her friends
and familiars called her the Duchess of Washington
Square) and Baby Van Rensselaer (she was quite
old enough to vote, had her sex been entitled to
that duty, but as the younger of two sisters she
was still the baby of the family)&mdash;the Duchess and
Baby Van Rensselaer were discussing the pleasant
English voice and the not unpleasant English
accent of a manly young lordling who was going to
America for sport. Uncle Larry and Dear Jones
were enticing each other into a bet on the ship's
run of the morrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll give you two to one she don't make 420,&rdquo;
said Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll take it,&rdquo; answered Uncle Larry. &ldquo;We
made 427 the fifth day last year.&rdquo; It was Uncle
Larry's seventeenth visit to Europe, and this was
therefore his thirty-fourth voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when did you get in?&rdquo; asked Baby Van
Rensselaer. &ldquo;I don't care a bit about the run, so
long as we get in soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We crossed the bar Sunday night, just seven days
after we left Queenstown, and we dropped anchor
off Quarantine at three o'clock on Monday morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we sha'n't do that this time. I can't
seem to sleep any when the boat stops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can, but I didn't,&rdquo; continued Uncle Larry,
&ldquo;because my stateroom was the most for'ard in
the boat, and the donkey-engine that let down the
anchor was right over my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you got up and saw the sun rise over the
bay,&rdquo; said Dear Jones, &ldquo;with the electric lights of
the city twinkling in the distance, and the first
faint flush of the dawn in the east just over Fort
Lafayette, and the rosy tinge which spread softly
upward, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you both come back together?&rdquo; asked the
Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he has crossed thirty-four times you
must not suppose he has a monopoly in sunrises,&rdquo;
retorted Dear Jones. &ldquo;No; this was my own sunrise;
and a mighty pretty one it was too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm not matching sunrises with you,&rdquo; remarked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Uncle Larry calmly; &ldquo;but I'm willing to
back a merry jest called forth by my sunrise against
any two merry jests called forth by yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess reluctantly that my sunrise evoked
no merry jest at all.&rdquo; Dear Jones was an honest
man, and would scorn to invent a merry jest on the
spur of the moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's where my sunrise has the call,&rdquo; said
Uncle Larry, complacently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the merry jest?&rdquo; was Baby Van
Rensselaer's inquiry, the natural result of a feminine
curiosity thus artistically excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here it is. I was standing aft, near a
patriotic American and a wandering Irishman, and
the patriotic American rashly declared that you
couldn't see a sunrise like that anywhere in Europe,
and this gave the Irishman his chance, and he said,
'Sure ye don't have'm here till we're through with
'em over there.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Dear Jones, thoughtfully,
&ldquo;that they do have some things over there better
than we do; for instance, umbrellas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And gowns,&rdquo; added the Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And antiquities.&rdquo;&mdash;this was Uncle Larry's
contribution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we do have some things so much better in
America!&rdquo; protested Baby Van Rensselaer, as yet
uncorrupted by any worship of the effete monarchies
of despotic Europe. &ldquo;We make lots of
things a great deal nicer than you can get them in
Europe&mdash;especially ice-cream.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And pretty girls,&rdquo; added Dear Jones; but he
did not look at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And spooks,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Larry, casually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spooks?&rdquo; queried the Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spooks. I maintain the word. Ghost, if you
like that better, or specters. We turn out the best
quality of spook&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget the lovely ghost stories about the
Rhine and the Black Forest,&rdquo; interrupted Miss
Van Rensselaer, with feminine inconsistency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember the Rhine and the Black Forest
and all the other haunts of elves and fairies and
hobgoblins; but for good honest spooks there is no
place like home. And what differentiates our
spook&mdash;<i>spiritus Americanus</i>&mdash;from the ordinary
ghost of literature is that it responds to the American
sense of humor. Take Irving's stories, for
example. The 'Headless Horseman'&mdash;that's a
comic ghost story. And Rip Van Winkle&mdash;consider
what humor, and what good humor, there is
in the telling of his meeting with the goblin crew
of Hendrik Hudson's men! A still better example
of this American way of dealing with legend
and mystery is the marvelous tale of the rival
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rival ghosts!&rdquo; queried the Duchess and
Baby Van Rensselaer together. &ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't I ever tell you about them?&rdquo; answered
Uncle Larry, a gleam of approaching joy flashing
from his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since he is bound to tell us sooner or later, we'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
better be resigned and hear it now,&rdquo; said Dear
Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are not more eager, I won't tell it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do, Uncle Larry! you know I just dote on
ghost stories,&rdquo; pleaded Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; began Uncle Larry&mdash;&ldquo;in
fact, a very few years ago&mdash;there lived in the thriving
town of New York a young American called
Duncan&mdash;Eliphalet Duncan. Like his name, he was
half Yankee and half Scotch, and naturally he was
a lawyer, and had come to New York to make his
way. His father was a Scotchman who had come
over and settled in Boston and married a Salem
girl. When Eliphalet Duncan was about twenty
he lost both of his parents. His father left him
enough money to give him a start, and a strong
feeling of pride in his Scotch birth; you see there
was a title in the family in Scotland, and although
Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger
son, yet he always remembered, and always bade
his only son to remember, that this ancestry was
noble. His mother left him her full share of Yankee
grit and a little old house in Salem which had
belonged to her family for more than two hundred
years. She was a Hitchcock, and the Hitchcocks
had been settled in Salem since the year 1. It was
a great-great-grandfather of Mr. Eliphalet Hitchcock
who was foremost in the time of the Salem
witchcraft craze. And this little old house which
she left to my friend, Eliphalet Duncan, was
haunted.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By the ghost of one of the witches, of course?&rdquo;
interrupted Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now how could it be the ghost of a witch, since
the witches were all burned at the stake? You
never heard of anybody who was burned having a
ghost, did you?&rdquo; asked Uncle Larry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's an argument in favor of cremation, at
any rate,&rdquo; replied Dear Jones, evading the direct
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, if you don't like ghosts. I do,&rdquo; said Baby
Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so do I,&rdquo; added Uncle Larry. &ldquo;I love a
ghost as dearly as an Englishman loves a lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on with your story,&rdquo; said the Duchess,
majestically overruling all extraneous discussion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This little old house at Salem was haunted,&rdquo;
resumed Uncle Larry. &ldquo;And by a very distinguished
ghost&mdash;or at least by a ghost with very
remarkable attributes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo; asked Baby Van Rensselaer,
with a premonitory shiver of anticipatory
delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It had a lot of peculiarities. In the first place,
it never appeared to the master of the house.
Mostly it confined its visitations to unwelcome
guests. In the course of the last hundred years
it had frightened away four successive mothers-in-law,
while never intruding on the head of the
household.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that ghost had been one of the boys
when he was alive and in the flesh.&rdquo; This was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Dear Jones's contribution to the telling of the
tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second place,&rdquo; continued Uncle Larry,
&ldquo;it never frightened anybody the first time it appeared.
Only on the second visit were the ghost-seers
scared; but then they were scared enough for
twice, and they rarely mustered up courage enough
to risk a third interview. One of the most curious
characteristics of this well-meaning spook was that
it had no face&mdash;or at least that nobody ever saw
its face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he kept his countenance veiled?&rdquo;
queried the Duchess, who was beginning to remember
that she never did like ghost stories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was what I was never able to find out.
I have asked several people who saw the ghost,
and none of them could tell me anything about its
face, and yet while in its presence they never
noticed its features, and never remarked on their
absence or concealment. It was only afterwards
when they tried to recall calmly all the circumstances
of meeting with the mysterious stranger
that they became aware that they had not seen its
face. And they could not say whether the features
were covered, or whether they were wanting, or
what the trouble was. They knew only that the
face was never seen. And no matter how often
they might see it, they never fathomed this mystery.
To this day nobody knows whether the
ghost which used to haunt the little old house in
Salem had a face, or what manner of face it had.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How awfully weird!&rdquo; said Baby Van Rensselaer.
&ldquo;And why did the ghost go away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven't said it went away,&rdquo; answered Uncle
Larry, with much dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said it <i>used</i> to haunt the little old
house at Salem, so I supposed it had moved.
Didn't it?&rdquo; the young lady asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall be told in due time. Eliphalet Duncan
used to spend most of his summer vacations at
Salem, and the ghost never bothered him at all,
for he was the master of the house&mdash;much to his
disgust, too, because he wanted to see for himself
the mysterious tenant at will of his property. But
he never saw it, never. He arranged with friends
to call him whenever it might appear, and he slept
in the next room with the door open; and yet when
their frightened cries waked him the ghost was
gone, and his only reward was to hear reproachful
sighs as soon as he went back to bed. You see, the
ghost thought it was not fair of Eliphalet to seek
an introduction which was plainly unwelcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dear Jones interrupted the story-teller by
getting up and tucking a heavy rug more snugly
around Baby Van Rensselaer's feet, for the sky
was now overcast and gray, and the air was damp
and penetrating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One fine spring morning,&rdquo; pursued Uncle
Larry, &ldquo;Eliphalet Duncan received great news.
I told you that there was a title in the family in
Scotland, and that Eliphalet's father was the
younger son of a younger son. Well, it happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that all Eliphalet's father's brothers and uncles
had died off without male issue except the eldest
son of the eldest son, and he, of course, bore the
title, and was Baron Duncan of Duncan. Now the
great news that Eliphalet Duncan received in
New York one fine spring morning was that Baron
Duncan and his only son had been yachting in the
Hebrides, and they had been caught in a black
squall, and they were both dead. So my friend
Eliphalet Duncan inherited the title and the
estates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How romantic!&rdquo; said the Duchess. &ldquo;So he
was a baron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Uncle Larry, &ldquo;he was a baron
if he chose. But he didn't choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More fool he!&rdquo; said Dear Jones, sententiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Uncle Larry, &ldquo;I'm not so
sure of that. You see, Eliphalet Duncan was half
Scotch and half Yankee, and he had two eyes to
the main chance. He held his tongue about his
windfall of luck until he could find out whether the
Scotch estates were enough to keep up the Scotch
title. He soon discovered that they were not, and
that the late Lord Duncan, having married money,
kept up such state as he could out of the revenues
of the dowry of Lady Duncan. And Eliphalet, he
decided that he would rather be a well-fed lawyer
in New York, living comfortably on his practice,
than a starving lord in Scotland, living scantily
on his title.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he kept his title?&rdquo; asked the Duchess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Uncle Larry, &ldquo;he kept it
quiet. I knew it, and a friend or two more. But
Eliphalet was a sight too smart to put 'Baron
Duncan of Duncan, Attorney and Counselor at
Law,' on his shingle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has all this got to do with your ghost?&rdquo;
asked Dear Jones, pertinently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing with that ghost, but a good deal with
another ghost. Eliphalet was very learned in spirit
lore&mdash;perhaps because he owned the haunted house
at Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by
descent. At all events, he had made a special study
of the wraiths and white ladies and banshees and
bogies of all kinds whose sayings and doings and
warnings are recorded in the annals of the Scottish
nobility. In fact, he was acquainted with the
habits of every reputable spook in the Scotch
peerage. And he knew that there was a Duncan
ghost attached to the person of the holder of the
title of Baron Duncan of Duncan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, besides being the owner of a haunted house
in Salem, he was also a haunted man in Scotland?&rdquo;
asked Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. But the Scotch ghost was not unpleasant,
like the Salem ghost, although it had one
peculiarity in common with its transatlantic fellow-spook.
It never appeared to the holder of the title,
just as the other never was visible to the owner of
the house. In fact, the Duncan ghost was never
seen at all. It was a guardian angel only. Its sole
duty was to be in personal attendance on Baron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Duncan of Duncan, and to warn him of impending
evil. The traditions of the house told that the
Barons of Duncan had again and again felt a premonition
of ill fortune. Some of them had yielded
and withdrawn from the venture they had undertaken,
and it had failed dismally. Some had been
obstinate, and had hardened their hearts, and had
gone on reckless to defeat and to death. In no
case had a Lord Duncan been exposed to peril
without fair warning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how came it that the father and son were
lost in the yacht off the Hebrides?&rdquo; asked Dear
Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they were too enlightened to yield to
superstition. There is extant now a letter of Lord
Duncan, written to his wife a few minutes before
he and his son set sail, in which he tells her how
hard he has had to struggle with an almost overmastering
desire to give up the trip. Had he
obeyed the friendly warning of the family ghost,
the letter would have been spared a journey across
the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as
soon as the old baron died?&rdquo; asked Baby Van
Rensselaer, with much interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did he come over,&rdquo; queried Dear Jones&mdash;&ldquo;in
the steerage, or as a cabin passenger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; answered Uncle Larry, calmly,
&ldquo;and Eliphalet didn't know. For as he was in no
danger, and stood in no need of warning, he couldn't
tell whether the ghost was on duty or not. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
course he was on the watch for it all the time.
But he never got any proof of its presence until he
went down to the little old house of Salem, just
before the Fourth of July. He took a friend down
with him&mdash;a young fellow who had been in the
regular army since the day Fort Sumter was fired
on, and who thought that after four years of the
little unpleasantness down South, including six
months in Libby, and after ten years of fighting
the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn't likely to
be much frightened by a ghost. Well, Eliphalet
and the officer sat out on the porch all the evening
smoking and talking over points in military law.
A little after twelve o'clock, just as they began to
think it was about time to turn in, they heard the
most ghastly noise in the house. It wasn't a shriek,
or a howl, or a yell, or anything they could put a
name to. It was an undeterminate, inexplicable
shiver and shudder of sound, which went wailing
out of the window. The officer had been at Cold
Harbor, but he felt himself getting colder this time.
Eliphalet knew it was the ghost who haunted the
house. As this weird sound died away, it was followed
by another, sharp, short, blood-curdling in
its intensity. Something in this cry seemed familiar
to Eliphalet, and he felt sure that it proceeded
from the family ghost, the warning wraith
of the Duncans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I understand you to intimate that both
ghosts were there together?&rdquo; inquired the Duchess,
anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of them were there,&rdquo; answered Uncle
Larry. &ldquo;You see, one of them belonged to the
house, and had to be there all the time, and the
other was attached to the person of Baron Duncan,
and had to follow him there; wherever he was,
there was that ghost also. But Eliphalet, he had
scarcely time to think this out when he heard both
sounds again, not one after another, but both
together, and something told him&mdash;some sort of an
instinct he had&mdash;that those two ghosts didn't
agree, didn't get on together, didn't exactly hit it
off; in fact, that they were quarreling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarreling ghosts! Well, I never!&rdquo; was Baby
Van Rensselaer's remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a blessed thing to see ghosts dwell together
in unity,&rdquo; said Dear Jones.</p>

<p>And the Duchess added, &ldquo;It would certainly be
setting a better example.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; resumed Uncle Larry, &ldquo;that two
waves of light or of sound may interfere and produce
darkness or silence. So it was with these rival
spooks. They interfered, but they did not produce
silence or darkness. On the contrary, as soon as
Eliphalet and the officer went into the house, there
began at once a series of spiritualistic manifestations&mdash;a
regular dark s&eacute;ance. A tambourine was
played upon, a bell was rung, and a flaming banjo
went singing around the room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did they get the banjo?&rdquo; asked Dear
Jones, sceptically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know. Materialized it, maybe, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
as they did the tambourine. You don't suppose a
quiet New York lawyer kept a stock of musical
instruments large enough to fit out a strolling
minstrel troupe just on the chance of a pair of
ghosts coming to give him a surprise party, do you?
Every spook has its own instrument of torture.
Angels play on harps, I'm informed, and spirits
delight in banjos and tambourines. These spooks
of Eliphalet Duncan's were ghosts with all modern
improvements, and I guess they were capable of
providing their own musical weapons. At all
events, they had them there in the little old house
at Salem the night Eliphalet and his friend came
down. And they played on them, and they rang
the bell, and they rapped here, there, and everywhere.
And they kept it up all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All night?&rdquo; asked the awe-stricken Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All night long,&rdquo; said Uncle Larry, solemnly;
&ldquo;and the next night too. Eliphalet did not get a
wink of sleep, neither did his friend. On the second
night the house ghost was seen by the officer; on
the third night it showed itself again; and the next
morning the officer packed his gripsack and took
the first train to Boston. He was a New Yorker,
but he said he'd sooner go to Boston than see that
ghost again. Eliphalet wasn't scared at all, partly
because he never saw either the domiciliary or the
titular spook, and partly because he felt himself on
friendly terms with the spirit world, and didn't
scare easily. But after losing three nights' sleep
and the society of his friend, he began to be a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
impatient, and to think that the thing had gone
far enough. You see, while in a way he was fond
of ghosts, yet he liked them best one at a time.
Two ghosts were one too many. He wasn't bent
on making a collection of spooks. He and one ghost
were company, but he and two ghosts were a crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; asked Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well he couldn't do anything. He waited
awhile, hoping they would get tired; but he got
tired out first. You see, it comes natural to a
spook to sleep in the daytime, but a man wants to
sleep nights, and they wouldn't let him sleep nights.
They kept on wrangling and quarreling incessantly;
they manifested and they dark-s&eacute;anced as
regularly as the old clock on the stairs struck
twelve; they rapped and they rang bells and they
banged the tambourine and they threw the flaming
banjo about the house, and, worse than all, they
swore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know that spirits were addicted to
bad language,&rdquo; said the Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did he know they were swearing? Could
he hear them?&rdquo; asked Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was just it,&rdquo; responded Uncle Larry;
&ldquo;he could not hear them&mdash;at least, not distinctly.
There were inarticulate murmurs and stifled
rumblings. But the impression produced on him
was that they were swearing. If they had only
sworn right out, he would not have minded it so
much, because he would have known the worst.
But the feeling that the air was full of suppressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
profanity was very wearing, and after standing it
for a week he gave up in disgust and went to the
White Mountains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving them to fight it out, I suppose,&rdquo; interjected
Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; explained Uncle Larry. &ldquo;They
could not quarrel unless he was present. You see,
he could not leave the titular ghost behind him,
and the domiciliary ghost could not leave the
house. When he went away he took the family
ghost with him, leaving the house ghost behind.
Now spooks can't quarrel when they are a hundred
miles apart any more than men can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what happened afterwards?&rdquo; asked Baby
Van Rensselaer, with a pretty impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most marvelous thing happened. Eliphalet
Duncan went to the White Mountains, and in the
car of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount
Washington he met a classmate whom he had not
seen for years, and this classmate introduced Duncan
to his sister, and this sister was a remarkably
pretty girl, and Duncan fell in love with her at first
sight, and by the time he got to the top of Mount
Washington he was so deep in love that he began
to consider his own unworthiness, and to wonder
whether she might ever be induced to care for him
a little&mdash;ever so little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't think that is so marvelous a thing,&rdquo;
said Dear Jones, glancing at Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was she?&rdquo; asked the Duchess, who had
once lived in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She was Miss Kitty Sutton, of San Francisco,
and she was a daughter of old Judge Sutton, of the
firm of Pixley &amp; Sutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very respectable family,&rdquo; assented the
Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope she wasn't a daughter of that loud and
vulgar old Mrs. Sutton whom I met at Saratoga one
summer four or five years ago?&rdquo; said Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably she was,&rdquo; Uncle Larry responded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a horrid old woman. The boys used to
call her Mother Gorgon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pretty Kitty Sutton with whom Eliphalet
Duncan had fallen in love was the daughter of
Mother Gorgon. But he never saw the mother,
who was in Frisco, or Los Angeles, or Santa F&eacute;, or
somewhere out West, and he saw a great deal of
the daughter, who was up in the White Mountains.
She was traveling with her brother and his wife,
and as they journeyed from hotel to hotel Duncan
went with them, and filled out the quartette. Before
the end of the summer he began to think about
proposing. Of course he had lots of chances, going
on excursions as they were every day. He made up
his mind to seize the first opportunity, and that
very evening he took her out for a moonlight row
on Lake Winipiseogee. As he handed her into the
boat he resolved to do it, and he had a glimmer of
suspicion that she knew he was going to do it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; said Dear Jones, &ldquo;never go out in a
rowboat at night with a young man unless you
mean to accept him.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it's best to refuse him, and get it
over once for all,&rdquo; said Baby Van Rensselaer,
impersonally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Eliphalet took the oars he felt a sudden
chill. He tried to shake it off, but in vain. He
began to have a growing consciousness of impending
evil. Before he had taken ten strokes&mdash;and
he was a swift oarsman&mdash;he was aware of a mysterious
presence between him and Miss Sutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it the guardian-angel ghost warning him
off the match?&rdquo; interrupted Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what it was,&rdquo; said Uncle Larry.
&ldquo;And he yielded to it, and kept his peace, and
rowed Miss Sutton back to the hotel with his proposal
unspoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More fool he,&rdquo; said Dear Jones. &ldquo;It will take
more than one ghost to keep me from proposing
when my mind is made up.&rdquo; And he looked at
Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next morning,&rdquo; continued Uncle Larry,
&ldquo;Eliphalet overslept himself, and when he went
down to a late breakfast he found that the Suttons
had gone to New York by the morning train. He
wanted to follow them at once, and again he felt
the mysterious presence overpowering his will.
He struggled two days, and at last he roused himself
to do what he wanted in spite of the spook.
When he arrived in New York it was late in the
evening. He dressed himself hastily, and went to
the hotel where the Suttons were, in the hope of
seeing at least her brother. The guardian angel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
fought every inch of the walk with him, until he
began to wonder whether, if Miss Sutton were to
take him, the spook would forbid the banns. At
the hotel he saw no one that night, and he went
home determined to call as early as he could the
next afternoon, and make an end of it. When he
left his office about two o'clock the next day to
learn his fate, he had not walked five blocks before
he discovered that the wraith of the Duncans had
withdrawn his opposition to the suit. There was
no feeling of impending evil, no resistance, no
struggle, no consciousness of an opposing presence.
Eliphalet was greatly encouraged. He walked
briskly to the hotel; he found Miss Sutton alone.
He asked her the question, and got his answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She accepted him, of course?&rdquo; said Baby Van
Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Uncle Larry. &ldquo;And while
they were in the first flush of joy, swapping confidences
and confessions, her brother came into the
parlor with an expression of pain on his face and a
telegram in his hand. The former was caused by
the latter, which was from Frisco, and which announced
the sudden death of Mrs. Sutton, their
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that was why the ghost no longer opposed
the match?&rdquo; questioned Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly. You see, the family ghost knew that
Mother Gorgon was an awful obstacle to Duncan's
happiness, so it warned him. But the moment the
obstacle was removed, it gave its consent at once.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The fog was lowering its thick, damp curtain,
and it was beginning to be difficult to see from one
end of the boat to the other. Dear Jones tightened
the rug which enwrapped Baby Van Rensselaer,
and then withdrew again into his own substantial
coverings.</p>

<p>Uncle Larry paused in his story long enough to
light another of the tiny cigars he always smoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I infer that Lord Duncan&rdquo;&mdash;the Duchess was
scrupulous in the bestowal of titles&mdash;&ldquo;saw no more
of the ghosts after he was married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never saw them at all, at any time, either before
or since. But they came very near breaking off
the match, and thus breaking two young hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't mean to say that they knew any
just cause or impediment why they should not
forever after hold their peace?&rdquo; asked Dear Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could a ghost, or even two ghosts, keep a
girl from marrying the man she loved?&rdquo; This was
Baby Van Rensselaer's question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems curious, doesn't it?&rdquo; and Uncle Larry
tried to warm himself by two or three sharp pulls
at his fiery little cigar. &ldquo;And the circumstances
are quite as curious as the fact itself. You see,
Miss Sutton wouldn't be married for a year after
her mother's death, so she and Duncan had lots of
time to tell each other all they knew. Eliphalet got
to know a good deal about the girls she went to
school with; and Kitty soon learned all about his
family. He didn't tell her about the title for a long
time, as he wasn't one to brag. But he described<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to her the little old house at Salem. And one evening
towards the end of the summer, the wedding-day
having been appointed for early in September,
she told him that she didn't want a bridal tour at
all; she just wanted to go down to the little old
house at Salem to spend her honeymoon in peace
and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to
bother them. Well, Eliphalet jumped at the suggestion:
it suited him down to the ground. All of a
sudden he remembered the spooks, and it knocked
him all of a heap. He had told her about the Duncan
banshee, and the idea of having an ancestral
ghost in personal attendance on her husband
tickled her immensely. But he had never said
anything about the ghost which haunted the little
old house at Salem. He knew she would be frightened
out of her wits if the house ghost revealed
itself to her, and he saw at once that it would be
impossible to go to Salem on their wedding trip.
So he told her all about it, and how whenever he
went to Salem the two ghosts interfered, and gave
dark s&eacute;ances and manifested and materialized and
made the place absolutely impossible. Kitty listened
in silence, and Eliphalet thought she had
changed her mind. But she hadn't done anything
of the kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like a man&mdash;to think she was going to,&rdquo;
remarked Baby Van Rensselaer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She just told him she could not bear ghosts
herself, but she would not marry a man who was
afraid of them.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like a girl&mdash;to be so inconsistent,&rdquo; remarked
Dear Jones.</p>

<p>Uncle Larry's tiny cigar had long been extinct.
He lighted a new one, and continued: &ldquo;Eliphalet
protested in vain. Kitty said her mind was made
up. She was determined to pass her honeymoon
in the little old house at Salem, and she was equally
determined not to go there as long as there were
any ghosts there. Until he could assure her that
the spectral tenant had received notice to quit, and
that there was no danger of manifestations and
materializing, she refused to be married at all.
She did not intend to have her honeymoon interrupted
by two wrangling ghosts, and the wedding
could be postponed until he had made ready
the house for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was an unreasonable young woman,&rdquo; said
the Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that's what Eliphalet thought, much as
he was in love with her. And he believed he could
talk her out of her determination. But he couldn't.
She was set. And when a girl is set, there's nothing
to do but to yield to the inevitable. And that's
just what Eliphalet did. He saw he would either
have to give her up or to get the ghosts out; and as
he loved her and did not care for the ghosts, he
resolved to tackle the ghosts. He had clear grit,
Eliphalet had&mdash;he was half Scotch and half Yankee
and neither breed turns tail in a hurry. So he made
his plans and he went down to Salem. As he said
good-by to Kitty he had an impression that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
was sorry she had made him go; but she kept up
bravely, and put a bold face on it, and saw him off,
and went home and cried for an hour, and was
perfectly miserable until he came back the next
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he succeed in driving the ghosts away?&rdquo;
asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with great interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's just what I'm coming to,&rdquo; said Uncle
Larry, pausing at the critical moment, in the
manner of the trained story-teller. &ldquo;You see,
Eliphalet had got a rather tough job, and he would
gladly have had an extension of time on the contract,
but he had to choose between the girl and
the ghosts, and he wanted the girl. He tried to
invent or remember some short and easy way with
ghosts, but he couldn't. He wished that somebody
had invented a specific for spooks&mdash;something that
would make the ghosts come out of the house and
die in the yard. He wondered if he could not tempt
the ghosts to run in debt, so that he might get the
sheriff to help him. He wondered also whether
the ghosts could not be overcome with strong
drink&mdash;a dissipated spook, a spook with delirium
tremens, might be committed to the inebriate
asylum. But none of these things seemed feasible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; interrupted Dear Jones.
&ldquo;The learned counsel will please speak to the
point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will regret this unseemly haste,&rdquo; said
Uncle Larry, gravely, &ldquo;when you know what
really happened.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it, Uncle Larry?&rdquo; asked Baby Van
Rensselaer. &ldquo;I'm all impatience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Uncle Larry proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliphalet went down to the little old house at
Salem, and as soon as the clock struck twelve the
rival ghosts began wrangling as before. Raps here,
there, and everywhere, ringing bells, banging tambourines,
strumming banjos sailing about the room,
and all the other manifestations and materializations
followed one another just as they had the
summer before. The only difference Eliphalet
could detect was a stronger flavor in the spectral
profanity; and this, of course, was only a vague
impression, for he did not actually hear a single
word. He waited awhile in patience, listening and
watching. Of course he never saw either of the
ghosts, because neither of them could appear to
him. At last he got his dander up, and he thought
it was about time to interfere, so he rapped on the
table, and asked for silence. As soon as he felt
that the spooks were listening to him he explained
the situation to them. He told them he was in
love, and that he could not marry unless they
vacated the house. He appealed to them as old
friends, and he laid claim to their gratitude. The
titular ghost had been sheltered by the Duncan
family for hundreds of years, and the domiciliary
ghost had had free lodging in the little old house at
Salem for nearly two centuries. He implored them
to settle their differences, and to get him out of his
difficulty at once. He suggested that they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
better fight it out then and there, and see who was
master. He had brought down with him all needful
weapons. And he pulled out his valise, and
spread on the table a pair of navy revolvers, a pair
of shotguns, a pair of dueling-swords, and a couple
of bowie knives. He offered to serve as second for
both parties, and to give the word when to begin.
He also took out of his valise a pack of cards and a
bottle of poison, telling them that if they wished to
avoid carnage they might cut the cards to see which
one should take the poison. Then he waited anxiously
for their reply. For a little space there was
silence. Then he became conscious of a tremulous
shivering in one corner of the room, and he remembered
that he had heard from that direction
what sounded like a frightened sigh when he made
the first suggestion of the duel. Something told
him that this was the domiciliary ghost, and that
it was badly scared. Then he was impressed by a
certain movement in the opposite corner of the
room, as though the titular ghost were drawing
himself up with offended dignity. Eliphalet
couldn't exactly see those things, because he never
saw the ghosts, but he felt them. After a silence
of nearly a minute a voice came from the corner
where the family ghost stood&mdash;a voice strong and
full, but trembling slightly with suppressed passion.
And this voice told Eliphalet it was plain enough
that he had not long been the head of the Duncans,
and that he had never properly considered the
characteristics of his race if now he supposed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
one of his blood could draw his sword against a
woman. Eliphalet said he had never suggested
that the Duncan ghost should raise his hand
against a woman, and all he wanted was that the
Duncan ghost should fight the other ghost. And
then the voice told Eliphalet that the other ghost
was a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Dear Jones, sitting up suddenly.
&ldquo;You don't mean to tell me that the ghost which
haunted the house was a woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those were the very words Eliphalet Duncan
used,&rdquo; said Uncle Larry; &ldquo;but he did not need to
wait for the answer. All at once he recalled the
traditions about the domiciliary ghost, and he
knew that what the titular ghost said was the fact.
He had never thought of the sex of a spook, but
there was no doubt whatever that the house ghost
was a woman. No sooner was this firmly fixed in
Eliphalet's mind than he saw his way out of the
difficulty. The ghosts must be married!&mdash;for then
there would be no more interference, no more quarreling,
no more manifestations and materializations,
no more dark s&eacute;ances, with their raps and
bells and tambourines and banjos. At first the
ghosts would not hear of it. The voice in the
corner declared that the Duncan wraith had never
thought of matrimony. But Eliphalet argued with
them, and pleaded and pursuaded and coaxed,
and dwelt on the advantages of matrimony. He
had to confess, of course, that he did not know how
to get a clergyman to marry them; but the voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
from the corner gravely told him that there need
be no difficulty in regard to that, as there was no
lack of spiritual chaplains. Then, for the first
time, the house ghost spoke, a low, clear, gentle
voice, and with a quaint, old-fashioned New England
accent, which contrasted sharply with the
broad Scotch speech of the family ghost. She said
that Eliphalet Duncan seemed to have forgotten
that she was married. But this did not upset Eliphalet
at all; he remembered the whole case clearly,
and he told her she was not a married ghost, but a
widow, since her husband had been hanged for
murdering her. Then the Duncan ghost drew
attention to the great disparity in their ages, saying
that he was nearly four hundred and fifty
years old, while she was barely two hundred. But
Eliphalet had not talked to juries for nothing; he
just buckled to, and coaxed those ghosts into matrimony.
Afterwards he came to the conclusion that
they were willing to be coaxed, but at the time he
thought he had pretty hard work to convince them
of the advantages of the plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he succeed?&rdquo; asked Baby Van Rensselaer,
with a woman's interest in matrimony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Uncle Larry. &ldquo;He talked the
wraith of the Duncans and the specter of the little
old house at Salem into a matrimonial engagement.
And from the time they were engaged he had no
more trouble with them. They were rival ghosts
no longer. They were married by their spiritual
chaplain the very same day that Eliphalet Duncan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
met Kitty Sutton in front of the railing of Grace
Church. The ghostly bride and bridegroom went
away at once on their bridal tour, and Lord and
Lady Duncan went down to the little old house at
Salem to pass their honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Larry stopped. His tiny cigar was out
again. The tale of the rival ghosts was told. A
solemn silence fell on the little party on the deck of
the ocean steamer, broken harshly by the hoarse
roar of the fog-horn.</p>

<h2>The Water Ghost of<br />
Harrowby Hall</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> JOHN KENDRICK BANGS</h4>


<p>The trouble with Harrowby Hall was that it was
haunted, and, what was worse, the ghost did not
content itself with merely appearing at the bedside
of the afflicted person who saw it, but persisted in
remaining there for one mortal hour before it would
disappear.</p>

<p>It never appeared except on Christmas Eve, and
then as the clock was striking twelve, in which
respect alone was it lacking in that originality
which in these days is a <i>sine qua non</i> of success in
spectral life. The owners of Harrowby Hall had
done their utmost to rid themselves of the damp
and dewy lady who rose up out of the best bedroom
floor at midnight, but without avail. They had
tried stopping the clock, so that the ghost would
not know when it was midnight; but she made her
appearance just the same, with that fearful miasmatic
personality of hers, and there she would
stand until everything about her was thoroughly
saturated.</p>

<p>Then the owners of Harrowby Hall caulked up
every crack in the floor with the very best quality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of hemp, and over this were placed layers of tar
and canvas; the walls were made waterproof, and
the doors and windows likewise, the proprietors
having conceived the notion that the unexorcised
lady would find it difficult to leak into the room
after these precautions had been taken; but even
this did not suffice. The following Christmas Eve
she appeared as promptly as before, and frightened
the occupant of the room quite out of his senses by
sitting down alongside of him and gazing with her
cavernous blue eyes into his; and he noticed, too,
that in her long, aqueously bony fingers bits of
dripping seaweed were entwined, the ends hanging
down, and these ends she drew across his forehead
until he became like one insane. And then he
swooned away, and was found unconscious in his
bed the next morning by his host, simply saturated
with sea-water and fright, from the combined effects
of which he never recovered, dying four
years later of pneumonia and nervous prostration
at the age of seventy-eight.</p>

<p>The next year the master of Harrowby Hall decided
not to have the best spare bedroom opened
at all, thinking that perhaps the ghost's thirst for
making herself disagreeable would be satisfied by
haunting the furniture, but the plan was as unavailing
as the many that had preceded it.</p>

<p>The ghost appeared as usual in the room&mdash;that
is, it was supposed she did, for the hangings were
dripping wet the next morning, and in the parlor
below the haunted room a great damp spot appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
on the ceiling. Finding no one there, she
immediately set out to learn the reason why, and
she chose none other to haunt than the owner of
the Harrowby himself. She found him in his own
cosey room drinking whiskey&mdash;whiskey undiluted&mdash;and
felicitating himself upon having foiled her
ghost-ship, when all of a sudden the curl went out
of his hair, his whiskey bottle filled and overflowed,
and he was himself in a condition similar to that of
a man who has fallen into a water-butt. When he
recovered from the shock, which was a painful one,
he saw before him the lady of the cavernous eyes
and seaweed fingers. The sight was so unexpected
and so terrifying that he fainted, but immediately
came to, because of the vast amount of water in his
hair, which, trickling down over his face, restored
his consciousness.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the master of Harrowby
was a brave man, and while he was not particularly
fond of interviewing ghosts, especially such quenching
ghosts as the one before him, he was not to be
daunted by an apparition. He had paid the lady
the compliment of fainting from the effects of his
first surprise, and now that he had come to he
intended to find out a few things he felt he had a
right to know. He would have liked to put on a
dry suit of clothes first, but the apparition declined
to leave him for an instant until her hour was up,
and he was forced to deny himself that pleasure.
Every time he would move she would follow him,
with the result that everything she came in contact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with got a ducking. In an effort to warm himself
up he approached the fire, an unfortunate move
as it turned out, because it brought the ghost
directly over the fire, which immediately was extinguished.
The whiskey became utterly valueless
as a comforter to his chilled system, because it was
by this time diluted to a proportion of ninety per
cent of water. The only thing he could do to ward
off the evil effects of his encounter he did, and that
was to swallow ten two-grain quinine pills, which
he managed to put into his mouth before the ghost
had time to interfere. Having done this, he turned
with some asperity to the ghost, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far be it from me to be impolite to a woman,
madam, but I'm hanged if it wouldn't please me
better if you'd stop these infernal visits of yours
to this house. Go sit out on the lake, if you like
that sort of thing; soak the water-butt, if you wish;
but do not, I implore you, come into a gentleman's
house and saturate him and his possessions in this
way. It is damned disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry Hartwick Oglethorpe,&rdquo; said the ghost,
in a gurgling voice, &ldquo;you don't know what you are
talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; returned the unhappy householder,
&ldquo;I wish that remark were strictly truthful. I
was talking about you. It would be shillings and
pence&mdash;nay, pounds, in my pocket, madam, if I
did not know you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a bit of specious nonsense,&rdquo; returned
the ghost, throwing a quart of indignation into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
face of the master of Harrowby. &ldquo;It may rank
high as repartee, but as a comment upon my statement
that you do not know what you are talking
about, it savors of irrelevant impertinence. You
do not know that I am compelled to haunt this
place year after year by inexorable fate. It is no
pleasure to me to enter this house, and ruin and
mildew everything I touch. I never aspired to be a
shower-bath, but it is my doom. Do you know
who I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; returned the master of Harrowby.
&ldquo;I should say you were the Lady of the
Lake, or Little Sallie Waters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a witty man for your years,&rdquo; said the
ghost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my humor is drier than yours ever will
be,&rdquo; returned the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt. I'm never dry. I am the Water
Ghost of Harrowby Hall, and dryness is a quality
entirely beyond my wildest hope. I have been the
incumbent of this highly unpleasant office for two
hundred years to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How the deuce did you ever come to get
elected?&rdquo; asked the master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through a suicide,&rdquo; replied the specter. &ldquo;I
am the ghost of that fair maiden whose picture
hangs over the mantelpiece in the drawing-room.
I should have been your great-great-great-great-great-aunt
if I had lived, Henry Hartwick Oglethorpe,
for I was the own sister of your great-great-great-great-grandfather.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what induced you to get this house into
such a predicament?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not to blame, sir,&rdquo; returned the lady.
&ldquo;It was my father's fault. He it was who built
Harrowby Hall, and the haunted chamber was to
have been mine. My father had it furnished in
pink and yellow, knowing well that blue and gray
formed the only combination of color I could tolerate.
He did it merely to spite me, and, with
what I deem a proper spirit, I declined to live in the
room; whereupon my father said I could live there
or on the lawn, he didn't care which. That night
I ran from the house and jumped over the cliff into
the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was rash,&rdquo; said the master of Harrowby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I've heard,&rdquo; returned the ghost. &ldquo;If I had
known what the consequences were to be I should
not have jumped; but I really never realized what
I was doing until after I was drowned. I had been
drowned a week when a sea-nymph came to me
and informed me that I was to be one of her followers
forever afterwards, adding that it should be
my doom to haunt Harrowby Hall for one hour
every Christmas Eve throughout the rest of eternity.
I was to haunt that room on such Christmas
Eves as I found it inhabited; and if it should turn
out not to be inhabited, I was and am to spend the
allotted hour with the head of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll sell the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you cannot do, for it is also required of
me that I shall appear as the deeds are to be delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to any purchaser, and divulge to him the
awful secret of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that on every Christmas
Eve that I don't happen to have somebody in
that guest-chamber, you are going to haunt me
wherever I may be, ruining my whiskey, taking all
the curl out of my hair, extinguishing my fire, and
soaking me through to the skin?&rdquo; demanded the
master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have stated the case, Oglethorpe. And
what is more,&rdquo; said the water ghost, &ldquo;it doesn't
make the slightest difference where you are, if I
find that room empty, wherever you may be I shall
douse you with my spectral pres&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the clock struck one, and immediately the
apparition faded away. It was perhaps more of a
trickle than a fade, but as a disappearance it was
complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By St. George and his Dragon!&rdquo; ejaculated the
master of Harrowby, wringing his hands. &ldquo;It is
guineas to hot-cross buns that next Christmas
there's an occupant of the spare room, or I spend
the night in a bathtub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the master of Harrowby would have lost
his wager had there been anyone there to take him
up, for when Christmas Eve came again he was in
his grave, never having recovered from the cold
contracted that awful night. Harrowby Hall was
closed, and the heir to the estate was in London,
where to him in his chambers came the same experience
that his father had gone through, saving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
only that, being younger and stronger, he survived
the shock. Everything in his rooms was ruined&mdash;his
clocks were rusted in the works; a fine collection
of water-color drawings was entirely obliterated
by the onslaught of the water ghost; and what was
worse, the apartments below his were drenched
with the water soaking through the floors, a
damage for which he was compelled to pay, and
which resulted in his being requested by his landlady
to vacate the premises immediately.</p>

<p>The story of the visitation inflicted upon his
family had gone abroad, and no one could be got
to invite him out to any function save afternoon
teas and receptions. Fathers of daughters declined
to permit him to remain in their houses later
than eight o'clock at night, not knowing but that
some emergency might arise in the supernatural
world which would require the unexpected appearance
of the water ghost in this on nights other than
Christmas Eve, and before the mystic hour when
weary churchyards, ignoring the rules which are
supposed to govern polite society, begin to yawn.
Nor would the maids themselves have aught to do
with him, fearing the destruction by the sudden
incursion of aqueous femininity of the costumes
which they held most dear.</p>

<p>So the heir of Harrowby Hall resolved, as his
ancestors for several generations before him had
resolved, that something must be done. His first
thought was to make one of his servants occupy
the haunted room at the crucial moment; but in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this he failed, because the servants themselves
knew the history of that room and rebelled. None
of his friends would consent to sacrifice their personal
comfort to his, nor was there to be found in
all England a man so poor as to be willing to occupy
the doomed chamber on Christmas Eve for pay.</p>

<p>Then the thought came to the heir to have the
fireplace in the room enlarged, so that he might
evaporate the ghost at its first appearance, and he
was felicitating himself upon the ingenuity of his
plan, when he remembered what his father had
told him&mdash;how that no fire could withstand the
lady's extremely contagious dampness. And then
he bethought him of steam-pipes. These, he remembered,
could lie hundreds of feet deep in water,
and still retain sufficient heat to drive the water
away in vapor; and as a result of this thought the
haunted room was heated by steam to a withering
degree, and the heir for six months attended daily
the Turkish baths, so that when Christmas Eve
came he could himself withstand the awful temperature
of the room.</p>

<p>The scheme was only partially successful. The
water ghost appeared at the specified time, and
found the heir of Harrowby prepared; but hot as
the room was, it shortened her visit by no more
than five minutes in the hour, during which time
the nervous system of the young master was well-nigh
shattered, and the room itself was cracked
and warped to an extent which required the outlay
of a large sum of money to remedy. And worse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
than this, as the last drop of the water ghost was
slowly sizzling itself out on the floor, she whispered
to her would-be conqueror that his scheme would
avail him nothing, because there was still water in
great plenty where she came from, and that next
year would find her rehabilitated and as exasperatingly
saturating as ever.</p>

<p>It was then that the natural action of the mind,
in going from one extreme to the other, suggested
to the ingenious heir of Harrowby the means by
which the water ghost was ultimately conquered,
and happiness once more came within the grasp
of the house of Oglethorpe.</p>

<p>The heir provided himself with a warm suit of
fur under-clothing. Donning this with the furry
side in, he placed over it a rubber garment, tight-fitting,
which he wore just as a woman wears a
jersey. On top of this he placed another set of
under-clothing, this suit made of wool, and over
this was a second rubber garment like the first.
Upon his head he placed a light and comfortable
diving helmet, and so clad, on the following Christmas
Eve he awaited the coming of his tormentor.</p>

<p>It was a bitterly cold night that brought to a
close this twenty-fourth day of December. The
air outside was still, but the temperature was below
zero. Within all was quiet, the servants of
Harrowby Hall awaiting with beating hearts the
outcome of their master's campaign against his
supernatural visitor.</p>

<p>The master himself was lying on the bed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
haunted room, clad as has already been indicated,
and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The clock clanged out the hour of twelve.</p>

<p>There was a sudden banging of doors, a blast of
cold air swept through the halls, the door leading
into the haunted chamber flew open, a splash was
heard, and the water ghost was seen standing at the
side of the heir of Harrowby, from whose outer
dress there streamed rivulets of water, but whose
own person deep down under the various garments
he wore was as dry and as warm as he could have
wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the young master of Harrowby.
&ldquo;I'm glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the most original man I've met, if
that is true,&rdquo; returned the ghost. &ldquo;May I ask
where did you get that hat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, madam,&rdquo; returned the master, courteously.
&ldquo;It is a little portable observatory I had
made for just such emergencies as this. But, tell
me, is it true that you are doomed to follow me
about for one mortal hour&mdash;to stand where I stand,
to sit where I sit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my delectable fate,&rdquo; returned the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We'll go out on the lake,&rdquo; said the master,
starting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can't get rid of me that way,&rdquo; returned the
ghost. &ldquo;The water won't swallow me up; in fact,
it will just add to my present bulk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the master, firmly, &ldquo;we
will go out on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir,&rdquo; returned the ghost, with a
pale reluctance, &ldquo;it is fearfully cold out there.
You will be frozen hard before you've been out ten
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I'll not,&rdquo; replied the master. &ldquo;I am
very warmly dressed. Come!&rdquo; This last in a tone
of command that made the ghost ripple.</p>

<p>And they started.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before the water ghost
showed signs of distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You walk too slowly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am nearly
frozen. My knees are so stiff now I can hardly
move. I beseech you to accelerate your step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to oblige a lady,&rdquo; returned the
master, courteously, &ldquo;but my clothes are rather
heavy, and a hundred yards an hour is about my
speed. Indeed, I think we would better sit down
here on this snowdrift, and talk matters over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not! Do not do so, I beg!&rdquo; cried the ghost.
&ldquo;Let me move on. I feel myself growing rigid as
it is. If we stop here, I shall be frozen stiff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, madam,&rdquo; said the master slowly, and
seating himself on an ice-cake&mdash;&ldquo;that is why I
have brought you here. We have been on this
spot just ten minutes; we have fifty more. Take
your time about it, madam, but freeze, that is all
I ask of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot move my right leg now,&rdquo; cried the
ghost, in despair, &ldquo;and my overskirt is a solid sheet
of ice. Oh, good, kind Mr. Oglethorpe, light a fire,
and let me go free from these icy fetters.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, madam. It cannot be. I have you
at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried the ghost, a tear trickling down
her frozen cheek. &ldquo;Help me, I beg. I congeal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Congeal, madam, congeal!&rdquo; returned Oglethorpe,
coldly. &ldquo;You have drenched me and mine
for two hundred and three years, madam. To-night
you have had your last drench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I shall thaw out again, and then you'll
see. Instead of the comfortably tepid, genial
ghost I have been in my past, sir, I shall be iced-water,&rdquo;
cried the lady, threateningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you won't, either,&rdquo; returned Oglethorpe;
&ldquo;for when you are frozen quite stiff, I shall send
you to a cold-storage warehouse, and there shall
you remain an icy work of art forever more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But warehouses burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they do, but this warehouse cannot burn.
It is made of asbestos and surrounding it are fireproof
walls, and within those walls the temperature
is now and shall forever be 416 degrees below the
zero point; low enough to make an icicle of any
flame in this world&mdash;or the next,&rdquo; the master
added, with an ill-suppressed chuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the last time let me beseech you. I would
go on my knees to you, Oglethorpe, were they not
already frozen. I beg of you do not doo&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here even the words froze on the water-ghost's
lips and the clock struck one. There was a
momentary tremor throughout the ice-bound form,
and the moon, coming out from behind a cloud,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
shone down on the rigid figure of a beautiful woman
sculptured in clear, transparent ice. There stood
the ghost of Harrowby Hall, conquered by the
cold, a prisoner for all time.</p>

<p>The heir of Harrowby had won at last, and to-day
in a large storage house in London stands the
frigid form of one who will never again flood the
house of Oglethorpe with woe and sea-water.</p>

<p>As for the heir of Harrowby, his success in coping
with a ghost has made him famous, a fame that
still lingers about him, although his victory took
place some twenty years ago; and so far from being
unpopular with the fair sex, as he was when we first
knew him, he has not only been married twice, but
is to lead a third bride to the altar before the year
is out.</p>

Strange Story from Pocock Island&mdash;A Materialized
Spirit that Will not Go back. The First Glimpse
of what May yet Cause very Extensive Trouble in
this World.</i></p></div>

<center>(The <i>Sun</i>, Saturday, December 19, 1874.)</center>


<p>We are permitted to make extracts from a
private letter which bears the signature of a gentleman
well known in business circles, and whose
veracity we have never heard called in question.
His statements are startling and well-nigh incredible,
but if true, they are susceptible of easy verification.
Yet the thoughtful mind will hesitate
about accepting them without the fullest proof,
for they spring upon the world a social problem
of stupendous importance. The dangers apprehended
by Mr. Malthus and his followers become
remote and commonplace by the side of this new
and terrible issue.</p>

<p>The letter is dated at Pocock Island, a small
township in Washington County, Maine, about
seventeen miles from the mainland and nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
midway between Mt. Desert and the Grand
Menan. The last state census accords to Pocock
Island a population of 311, mostly engaged in the
porgy fisheries. At the Presidential election of
1872 the island gave Grant a majority of three.
These two facts are all that we are able to learn
of the locality from sources outside of the letter
already referred to.</p>

<p>The letter, omitting certain passages which refer
solely to private matters, reads as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But enough of the disagreeable business that
brought me here to this bleak island in the month
of November. I have a singular story to tell you.
After our experience together at Chittenden I
know you will not reject statements because they
are startling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend, there is upon Pocock Island a
materialized spirit which (or who) refuses to be
dematerialized. At this moment and within a
quarter of a mile from me as I write, a man who
died and was buried four years ago, and who has
exploited the mysteries beyond the grave, walks,
talks, and holds interviews with the inhabitants of
the island, and is, to all appearances, determined
to remain permanently upon this side of the river.
I will relate the circumstances as briefly as I can.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>JOHN NEWBEGIN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;In April, 1870, John Newbegin died and was
buried in the little cemetery on the landward side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the island. Newbegin was a man of about
forty-eight, without family or near connections,
and eccentric to a degree that sometimes inspired
questions as to his sanity. What money he had
earned by many seasons' fishing upon the banks
was invested in quarters of two small mackerel
schooners, the remainder of which belonged to
John Hodgeson, the richest man on Pocock, who
was estimated by good authorities to be worth
thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Newbegin was not without a certain kind of
culture. He had read a good deal of the odds and
ends of literature and, as a simple-minded islander
expressed it in my hearing, knew more bookfuls
than anybody on the island. He was naturally
an intelligent man; and he might have attained
influence in the community had it not been
for his utter aimlessness of character, his indifference
to fortune, and his consuming thirst for
rum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many yachtsmen who have had occasion to
stop at Pocock for water or for harbor shelter during
eastern cruises, will remember a long, listless
figure, astonishingly attired in blue army pants,
rubber boots, loose toga made of some bright chintz
material, and very bad hat, staggering through the
little settlement, followed by a rabble of jeering
brats, and pausing to strike uncertain blows at
those within reach of the dead sculpin which he
usually carried round by the tail. This was John
Newbegin.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>


<h4>HIS SUDDEN DEATH</h4>

<p>&ldquo;As I have already remarked, he died four years
ago last April. The <i>Mary Emmeline</i>, one of the
little schooners in which he owned, had returned
from the eastward, and had smuggled, or 'run in'
a quantity of St. John brandy. Newbegin had a
solitary and protracted debauch. He was missed
from his accustomed walks for several days, and
when the islanders broke into the hovel where he
lived, close down to the seaweed and almost within
reach of the incoming tide, they found him dead on
the floor, with an emptied demijohn hard by his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After the primitive custom of the island, they
interred John Newbegin's remains without coroner's
inquest, burial certificate, or funeral services,
and in the excitement of a large catch of porgies
that summer, soon forgot him and his friendless
life. His interest in the <i>Mary Emmeline</i> and the
<i>Prettyboat</i> recurred to John Hodgeson; and as nobody
came forward to demand an administration
of the estate, it was never administered. The
forms of law are but loosely followed in some of
these marginal localities.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>HIS REAPPEARANCE AT POCOCK</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear &mdash;&mdash;, four years and four
months had brought their quota of varying seasons
to Pocock Island when John Newbegin reappeared
under the following circumstances:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the latter part of last August, as you may
remember, there was a heavy gale all along our
Atlantic coast. During this storm the squadron of
the Naugatuck Yacht Club, which was returning
from a summer cruise as far as Campobello, was
forced to take shelter in the harbor to the leeward
of Pocock Island. The gentlemen of the club
spent three days at the little settlement ashore.
Among the party was Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; E&mdash;&mdash;, by which
name you will recognize a medium of celebrity, and
one who has been particularly successful in materializations.
At the desire of his companions, and to
relieve the tedium of their detention, Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;
improvised a cabinet in the little schoolhouse at
Pocock, and gave a <i>s&eacute;ance</i>, to the delight of his
fellow yachtsmen and the utter bewilderment of
such natives as were permitted to witness the
manifestations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conditions appeared unusually favorable
to spirit appearances and the <i>s&eacute;ance</i> was upon the
whole perhaps the most remarkable that Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;
ever held. It was all the more remarkable because
the surroundings were such that the most prejudiced
skeptic could discover no possibility of
trickery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first form to issue from the wood closet
which constituted the cabinet, when Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;
had been tied therein by a committee of old sailors
from the yachts, was that of an Indian chief who
announced himself as Hock-a-mock, and who retired
after dancing a 'Harvest Moon' <i>pas seul</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and declaring himself in very emphatic terms, as
opposed to the present Indian policy of the Administration.
Hock-a-mock was succeeded by the
aunt of one of the yachtsmen, who identified herself
beyond question by allusion to family matters
and by displaying the scar of a burn upon her left
arm, received while making tomato catsup upon
earth. Then came successively a child whom none
present recognized, a French Canadian who could
not talk English, and a portly gentleman who introduced
himself as William King, first Governor
of Maine. These in turn re&euml;ntered the cabinet
and were seen no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was some time before another spirit manifested
itself, and Mr. E&mdash;&mdash; gave directions that
the lights be turned down still further. Then the
door of the wood closet was slowly opened and a
singular figure in rubber boots and a species of
Dolly Varden garment emerged, bringing a dead
fish in his right hand.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>HIS DETERMINATION TO REMAIN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;The city men who were present, I am told,
thought that the medium was masquerading in
grotesque habiliments for the more complete astonishment
of the islanders, but these latter rose
from their seats and exclaimed with one consent:
'It is John Newbegin!' And then, in not unnatural
terror of the apparition they turned and fled from
the schoolroom, uttering dismal cries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;John Newbegin came calmly forward and
turned up the solitary kerosene lamp that shed uncertain
light over the proceedings. He then sat
down in the teacher's chair, folded his arms, and
looked complacently about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'You might as well untie the medium,' he
finally remarked. 'I propose to remain in the
materialized condition.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he did remain. When the party left the
schoolhouse among them walked John Newbegin,
as truly a being of flesh and blood as any man of
them. From that day to this, he has been a living
inhabitant of Pocock Island, eating, drinking,
(water only) and sleeping after the manner of men.
The yachtsmen who made sail for Bar Harbor the
very next morning, probably believe that he was a
fraud hired for the occasion by Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;. But
the people of Pocock, who laid him out, dug his
grave, and put him into it four years ago, know that
John Newbegin has come back to them from a land
they know not of.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>A SINGULAR MEMBER OF SOCIETY</h4>

<p>&ldquo;The idea, of having a ghost&mdash;somewhat more
condensed it is true than the traditional ghost&mdash;as
a member was not at first overpleasing to the 311
inhabitants of Pocock Island. To this day, they
are a little sensitive upon the subject, feeling evidently
that if the matter got abroad, it might injure
the sale of the really excellent porgy oil which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is the product of their sole manufacturing interest.
This reluctance to advertise the skeleton in their
closet, superadded to the slowness of these obtuse,
fishy, matter-of-fact people to recognize the transcendent
importance of the case, must be accepted
as explanation of the fact that John Newbegin's
spirit has been on earth between three and four
months, and yet the singular circumstance is not
known to the whole country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the Pocockians have at last come to see
that a spirit is not necessarily a malevolent spirit,
and accepting his presence as a fact in their stolid,
unreasoning way, they are quite neighborly and
sociable with Mr. Newbegin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that your first question will be: 'Is
there sufficient proof of his ever having been dead?'
To this I answer unhesitatingly, 'Yes.' He was
too well-known a character and too many people
saw the corpse to admit of any mistake on this
point. I may add here that it was at one time
proposed to disinter the original remains, but that
project was abandoned in deference to the wishes
of Mr. Newbegin, who feels a natural delicacy
about having his first set of bones disturbed from
motives of mere curiosity.&rdquo;</p>


<h4>AN INTERVIEW WITH A DEAD MAN</h4>

<p>&ldquo;You will readily believe that I took occasion to
see and converse with John Newbegin. I found
him affable and even communicative. He is perfectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
aware of his doubtful status as a being, but
is in hopes that at some future time there may be
legislation that shall correctly define his position
and the position of any spirit who may follow him
into the material world. The only point upon
which he is reticent is his experience during the
four years that elapsed between his death and his
reappearance at Pocock. It is to be presumed that
the memory is not a pleasant one: at least he never
speaks of this period. He candidly admits, however,
that he is glad to get back to earth and that
he embraced the very first opportunity to be
materialized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Newbegin says that he is consumed with
remorse for the wasted years of his previous existence.
Indeed, his conduct during the past three
months would show that this regret is genuine.
He has discarded his eccentric costume, and dresses
like a reasonable spirit. He has not touched liquor
since his reappearance. He has embarked in the
porgy oil business, and his operations already rival
that of Hodgeson, his old partner in the <i>Mary
Emmeline</i> and the <i>Prettyboat</i>. By the way, Newbegin
threatens to sue Hodgeson for his individed
quarter in each of these vessels, and this interesting
case therefore bids fair to be thoroughly investigated
in the courts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a business man, he is generally esteemed on
the Island, although there is a noticeable reluctance
to discount his paper at long dates. In short,
Mr. John Newbegin is a most respectable citizen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
(if a dead man can be a citizen) and has announced
his intention of running for the next Legislature!&rdquo;</p>


<h4>IN CONCLUSION</h4>

<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear &mdash;&mdash;, I have told you the
substance of all I know respecting this strange,
strange case. Yet, after all, why so strange? We
accepted materialization at Chittenden. Is this
any more than the logical issue of that admission?
If the spirit may return to earth, clothed in flesh
and blood and all the physical attributes of humanity,
why may it not remain on earth as long as it
sees fit?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking of it from whatever standpoint, I
cannot but regard John Newbegin as the pioneer
of a possibly large immigration from the spirit
world. The bars once down, a whole flock will
come trooping back to earth. Death will lose its
significance altogether. And when I think of the
disturbance which will result in our social relations,
of the overthrow of all accepted institutions, and
of the nullification of all principles of political
economy, law, and religion, I am lost in perplexity
and apprehension.&rdquo;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> RICHARD MIDDLETON</h4>


<p>Fairfield is a little village lying near the Portsmouth
Road, about halfway between London and
the sea. Strangers, who now and then find it by
accident, call it a pretty, old-fashioned place; we
who live in it and call it home don't find anything
very pretty about it, but we should be sorry to
live anywhere else. Our minds have taken the
shape of the inn and the church and the green, I
suppose. At all events, we never feel comfortable
out of Fairfield.</p>

<p>Of course the cockneys, with their vasty houses
and noise-ridden streets, can call us rustics if they
choose; but for all that, Fairfield is a better place
to live in than London. Doctor says that when he
goes to London his mind is bruised with the weight
of the houses, and he was a cockney born. He had
to live there himself when he was a little chap, but
he knows better now. You gentlemen may laugh&mdash;perhaps
some of you come from London-way,&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it seems to me that a witness like that is worth
a gallon of arguments.</p>

<p>Dull? Well, you might find it dull, but I assure
you that I've listened to all the London yarns you
have spun to-night, and they're absolutely nothing
to the things that happen at Fairfield. It's because
of our way of thinking, and minding our own business.
If one of your Londoners was set down on
the green of a Saturday night when the ghosts of
the lads who died in the war keep tryst with the
lasses who lie in the churchyard, he couldn't help
being curious and interfering, and then the ghosts
would go somewhere where it was quieter. But we
just let them come and go and don't make any fuss,
and in consequence Fairfield is the ghostiest place
in all England. Why, I've seen a headless man
sitting on the edge of the well in broad daylight,
and the children playing about his feet as if he
were their father. Take my word for it, spirits
know when they are well off as much as human
beings.</p>

<p>Still, I must admit that the thing I'm going to
tell you about was queer even for our part of the
world, where three packs of ghost-hounds hunt
regularly during the season, and blacksmith's
great-grandfather is busy all night shoeing the
dead gentlemen's horses. Now that's a thing that
wouldn't happen in London, because of their interfering
ways; but blacksmith he lies up aloft and
sleeps as quiet as a lamb. Once when he had a bad
head he shouted down to them not to make so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
much noise, and in the morning he found an old
guinea left on the anvil as an apology. He wears
it on his watch-chain now. But I must get on with
my story; if I start telling you about the queer happenings
at Fairfield, I'll never stop.</p>

<p>It all came of the great storm in the spring of '97,
the year that we had two great storms. This was
the first one, and I remember it well, because I
found in the morning that it had lifted the thatch
of my pigsty into the widow's garden as clean as a
boy's kite. When I looked over the hedge, widow&mdash;Tom
Lamport's widow that was&mdash;was prodding
for her nasturtiums with a daisy grubber. After
I had watched her for a little I went down to the
Fox and Grapes to tell landlord what she had said
to me. Landlord he laughed, being a married man
and at ease with the sex. &ldquo;Come to that,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;the tempest has blowed something into my
field. A kind of a ship I think it would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was surprised at that until he explained that
it was only a ghost-ship, and would do no hurt to
the turnips. We argued that it had been blown
up from the sea at Portsmouth, and then we talked
of something else. There were two slates down at
the parsonage and a big tree in Lumley's meadow.
It was a rare storm.</p>

<p>I reckon the wind had blown our ghosts all over
England. They were coming back for days afterward
with foundered horses, and as footsore as
possible, and they were so glad to get back to Fairfield
that some of them walked up the street crying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
like little children. Squire said that his great-grandfather's
great-grandfather hadn't looked so
dead-beat since the battle of Naseby, and he's an
educated man.</p>

<p>What with one thing and another, I should think
it was a week before we got straight again, and then
one afternoon I met the landlord on the green, and
he had a worried face. &ldquo;I wish you'd come and
have a look at that ship in my field,&rdquo; he said to me.
&ldquo;It seems to me it's leaning real hard on the turnips.
I can't bear thinking what the missus will
say when she sees it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked down the lane with him, and, sure
enough, there was a ship in the middle of his field,
but such a ship as no man had seen on the water
for three hundred years, let alone in the middle of a
turnipfield. It was all painted black, and covered
with carvings, and there was a great bay-window
in the stern, for all the world like the squire's drawing-room.
There was a crowd of little black cannon
on deck and looking out of her port-holes, and she
was anchored at each end to the hard ground. I
have seen the wonders of the world on picture-postcards,
but I have never seen anything to equal
that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems very solid for a ghost-ship,&rdquo; I said,
seeing that landlord was bothered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it's a betwixt and between,&rdquo; he
answered, puzzling it over; &ldquo;but it's going to spoil
a matter of fifty turnips, and missus she'll want it
moved.&rdquo; We went up to her and touched the side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and it was as hard as a real ship. &ldquo;Now, there's
folks in England would call that very curious,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know much about ships, but I
should think that that ghost-ship weighed a solid
two hundred tons, and it seemed to me that she had
come to stay; so that I felt sorry for landlord, who
was a married man. &ldquo;All the horses in Fairfield
won't move her out of my turnips,&rdquo; he said, frowning
at her.</p>

<p>Just then we heard a noise on her deck, and we
looked up and saw that a man had come out of her
front cabin and was looking down at us very peaceably.
He was dressed in a black uniform set off
with rusty gold lace, and he had a great cutlass by
his side in a brass sheath. &ldquo;I'm Captain Bartholomew
Roberts,&rdquo; he said in a gentleman's voice,
&ldquo;put in for recruits. I seem to have brought her
rather far up the harbor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harbor!&rdquo; cried landlord. &ldquo;Why, you're fifty
miles from the sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Roberts didn't turn a hair. &ldquo;So much
as that, is it?&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Well, it's of no
consequence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Landlord was a bit upset at this. &ldquo;I don't want
to be unneighborly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I wish you
hadn't brought your ship into my field. You see,
my wife sets great store on these turnips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain took a pinch of snuff out of a fine
gold box that he pulled out of his pocket, and
dusted his fingers with a silk handkerchief in a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
genteel fashion. &ldquo;I'm only here for a few months,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but if a testimony of my esteem would
pacify your good lady, I should be content,&rdquo; and
with the words he loosed a great gold brooch from
the neck of his coat and tossed it down to landlord.</p>

<p>Landlord blushed as red as a strawberry. &ldquo;I'm
not denying she's fond of jewelry,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
it's too much for half a sackful of turnips.&rdquo; Indeed
it was a handsome brooch.</p>

<p>The captain laughed. &ldquo;Tut, man!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;it's a forced sale, and you deserve a good price.
Say no more about it,&rdquo; and nodding good day to
us, he turned on his heel and went into the cabin.
Landlord walked back up the lane like a man with
a weight off his mind. &ldquo;That tempest has blowed
me a bit of luck,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the missus will be main
pleased with that brooch. It's better than blacksmith's
guinea any day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>'97 was Jubilee year&mdash;the year of the second
Jubilee, you remember, and we had great doings at
Fairfield, so that we hadn't much time to bother
about the ghost-ship, though, anyhow, it isn't our
way to meddle in things that don't concern us.
Landlord he saw his tenant once or twice when he
was hoeing his turnips, and passed the time of day
and landlord's wife wore her new brooch to church
every Sunday. But we didn't mix much with the
ghosts at any time, all except an idiot lad there was
in the village, and he didn't know the difference
between a man and a ghost, poor innocent! On
Jubilee day, however, somebody told Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Roberts why the church bells were ringing, and he
hoisted a flag and fired off his guns like a loyal
Englishman. 'T is true the guns were shotted, and
one of the round shot knocked a hole in Farmer
Johnstone's barn, but nobody thought much of
that in such a season of rejoicing.</p>

<p>It wasn't till our celebrations were over that
we noticed that anything was wrong in Fairfield.
'T was shoemaker who told me first about it one
morning at the Fox and Grapes. &ldquo;You know my
great-great-uncle?&rdquo; he said to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Joshua, the quiet lad?&rdquo; I answered,
knowing him well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; said shoemaker, indignantly. &ldquo;Quiet
you call him, coming home at three o'clock every
morning as drunk as a magistrate and waking up
the whole house with his noise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it can't be Joshua,&rdquo; I said, for I knew
him for one of the most respectable young ghosts
in the village.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joshua it is,&rdquo; said shoemaker; &ldquo;and one of
these nights he'll find himself out in the street if
he isn't careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This kind of talk shocked me, I can tell you, for
I don't like to hear a man abusing his own family,
and I could hardly believe that a steady youngster
like Joshua had taken to drink. But just then in
came butcher Aylwin in such a temper that he
could hardly drink his beer. &ldquo;The young puppy!
The young puppy!&rdquo; he kept on saying, and it was
some time before shoemaker and I found out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that he was talking about his ancestor that fell at
Senlac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drink?&rdquo; said shoemaker, hopefully, for we all
like company in our misfortunes, and butcher
nodded grimly. &ldquo;The young noodle!&rdquo; he said,
emptying his tankard.</p>

<p>Well, after that I kept my ears open, and it was
the same story all over the village. There was
hardly a young man among all the ghosts of Fairfield
who didn't roll home in the small hours of the
morning the worse for liquor. I used to wake up
in the night and hear them stumble past my house,
singing outrageous songs. The worst of it was that
we couldn't keep the scandal to ourselves, and the
folk at Greenhill began to talk of &ldquo;sodden Fairfield&rdquo;
and taught their children to sing a song
about us:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sodden Fairfield, sodden Fairfield,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has no use for bread and butter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rum for breakfast, rum for dinner,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rum for tea, and rum for supper!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are easy-going in our village, but we didn't like
that.</p>

<p>Of course we soon found out where the young
fellows went to get the drink, and landlord was
terribly cut up that his tenant should have turned
out so badly; but his wife wouldn't hear of parting
with the brooch, so he couldn't give the captain
notice to quit. But as time went on, things grew
from bad to worse, and at all hours of the day you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
would see those young reprobates sleeping it off on
the village green. Nearly every afternoon a ghost-wagon
used to jolt down to the ship with a lading
of rum, and though the older ghosts seemed inclined
to give the captain's hospitality the go-by,
the youngsters were neither to hold nor to bind.</p>

<p>So one afternoon when I was taking my nap, I
heard a knock at the door, and there was parson,
looking very serious, like a man with a job before
him that he didn't altogether relish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm going down to talk to the captain about all
this drunkenness in the village, and I want you to
come with me,&rdquo; he said straight out.</p>

<p>I can't say that I fancied the visit much myself,
and I tried to hint to parson that as, after all, they
were only a lot of ghosts, it didn't much matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead or alive, I'm responsible for their good
conduct,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I'm going to do my duty
and put a stop to this continued disorder. And you
are coming with me, John Simmons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I went, parson being a persuasive kind of
man.</p>

<p>We went down to the ship, and as we approached
her, I could see the captain tasting the air on deck.
When he saw parson, he took off his hat very
politely, and I can tell you that I was relieved to
find that he had a proper respect for the cloth.
Parson acknowledged his salute, and spoke out
stoutly enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I should be glad to have a word with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on board, sir; come on board,&rdquo; said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
captain, and I could tell by his voice that he knew
why we were there.</p>

<p>Parson and I climbed up an uneasy kind of
ladder, and the captain took us into the great cabin
at the back of the ship, where the bay-window was.
It was the most wonderful place you ever saw in
your life, all full of gold and silver plate, swords
with jeweled scabbards, carved oak chairs, and
great chests that looked as though they were bursting
with guineas. Even parson was surprised, and
he did not shake his head very hard when the
captain took down some silver cups and poured us
out a drink of rum. I tasted mine, and I don't
mind saying that it changed my view of things
entirely. There was nothing betwixt and between
about that rum, and I felt that it was ridiculous to
blame the lads for drinking too much of stuff like
that. It seemed to fill my veins with honey and fire.</p>

<p>Parson put the case squarely to the captain, but
I didn't listen much to what he said. I was busy
sipping my drink and looking through the window
at the fishes swimming to and fro over landlord's
turnips. Just then it seemed the most natural
thing in the world that they should be there,
though afterward, of course, I could see that that
proved it was a ghost-ship.</p>

<p>But even then I thought it was queer when I
saw a drowned sailor float by in the thin air, with
his hair and beard all full of bubbles. It was the
first time I had seen anything quite like that at
Fairfield.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>All the time I was regarding the wonders of the
deep, parson was telling Captain Roberts how
there was no peace or rest in the village owing to
the curse of drunkenness, and what a bad example
the youngsters were setting to the older ghosts.
The captain listened very attentively, and put in a
word only now and then about boys being boys and
young men sowing their wild oats. But when parson
had finished his speech, he filled up our silver
cups and said to parson with a flourish:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be sorry to cause trouble anywhere
where I have been made welcome, and you will be
glad to hear that I put to sea to-morrow night.
And now you must drink me a prosperous voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we all stood up and drank the toast with
honor, and that noble rum was like hot oil in my
veins.</p>

<p>After that, captain showed us some of the curiosities
he had brought back from foreign parts,
and we were greatly amazed, though afterward I
couldn't clearly remember what they were. And
then I found myself walking across the turnips
with parson, and I was telling him of the glories
of the deep that I had seen through the window of
the ship. He turned on me severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were you, John Simmons,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
should go straight home to bed.&rdquo; He has a way of
putting things that wouldn't occur to an ordinary
man, has parson, and I did as he told me.</p>

<p>Well, next day it came on to blow, and it blew
harder and harder, till about eight o'clock at night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I heard a noise and looked out into the garden. I
dare say you won't believe me,&mdash;it seems a bit tall
even to me,&mdash;but the wind had lifted the thatch
of my pigsty into the widow's garden a second
time. I thought I wouldn't wait to hear what
widow had to say about it, so I went across the
green to the Fox and Grapes, and the wind was so
strong that I danced along on tiptoe like a girl at
the fair. When I got to the inn, landlord had to
help me shut the door. It seemed as though a
dozen goats were pushing against it to come in
out of the storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a powerful tempest,&rdquo; he said, drawing the
beer. &ldquo;I hear there's a chimney down at Dickory
End.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's a funny thing how these sailors know about
the weather,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;When captain said
he was going to-night, I was thinking it would take
a capful of wind to carry the ship back to sea; and
now here's more than a capful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said landlord; &ldquo;it's to-night he goes
true enough, and mind you, though he treated me
handsome over the rent, I'm not sure it's a loss to
the village. I don't hold with gentrice, who fetch
their drink from London instead of helping local
traders to get their living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you haven't got any rum like his,&rdquo; I said,
to draw him out.</p>

<p>His neck grew red above his collar, and I was
afraid I'd gone too far; but after a while he got his
breath with a grunt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;John Simmons,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you've come
down here this windy night to talk a lot of fool's
talk, you've wasted a journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, of course then I had to smooth him down
with praising his rum, and Heaven forgive me for
swearing it was better than captain's. For the
like of that rum no living lips have tasted save
mine and parson's. But somehow or other I
brought landlord round, and presently we must
have a glass of his best to prove its quality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beat that if you can,&rdquo; he cried, and we both
raised our glasses to our mouths, only to stop halfway
and look at each other in amaze. For the
wind that had been howling outside like an outrageous
dog had all of a sudden turned as melodious
as the carol-boys of a Christmas eve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely that's not my Martha,&rdquo; whispered landlord,
Martha being his great-aunt who lived in the
loft overhead.</p>

<p>We went to the door, and the wind burst it open
so that the handle was driven clean into the plaster
of the wall, but we didn't think about that at the
time; for over our heads, sailing very comfortably
through the windy stars, was the ship that had
passed the summer in landlord's field. Her port-holes
and her bay-window were blazing with lights,
and there was a noise of singing and fiddling on her
decks. &ldquo;He's gone!&rdquo; shouted landlord above the
storm, &ldquo;and he's taken half the village with him.&rdquo;
I could only nod in answer, not having lungs like
bellows of leather.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning we were able to measure the
strength of the storm, and over and above my
pigsty, there was damage enough wrought in the
village to keep us busy. True it is that the children
had to break down no branches for the firing that
autumn, since the wind had strewn the woods with
more than they could carry away. Many of our
ghosts were scattered abroad, but this time very
few came back, all the young men having sailed
with captain; and not only ghosts, for a poor half-witted
lad was missing, and we reckoned that he
had stowed himself away or perhaps shipped as
cabin-boy, not knowing any better.</p>

<p>What with the lamentations of the ghost girls
and the grumblings of families who had lost ancestors,
the village was upset for a while, and the
funny thing was that it was the folk who had complained
most of the carryings-on of the youngsters
who made most noise now that they were gone. I
hadn't any sympathy with shoemaker or butcher,
who ran about saying how much they missed their
lads, but it made me grieve to hear the poor bereaved
girls calling their lovers by name on the
village green at nightfall. It didn't seem fair to
me that they should have lost their men a second
time, after giving up life in order to join them, as
like as not. Still, not even a spirit can be sorry
forever, and after a few months we made up our
mind that the folk who had sailed in the ship were
never coming back; and we didn't talk about it
any more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>And then one day, I dare say it would be a couple
of years after, when the whole business was quite
forgotten, who should come trapesing along the
road from Portsmouth but the daft lad who had
gone away with the ship without waiting till he
was dead to become a ghost. You never saw such a
boy as that in all your life. He had a great rusty
cutlass hanging to a string at his waist, and he was
tattooed all over in fine colors, so that even his
face looked like a girl's sampler. He had a handkerchief
in his hand full of foreign shells and old-fashioned
pieces of small money, very curious, and
he walked up to the well outside his mother's house
and drew himself a drink as if he had been nowhere
in particular.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that he had come back as
soft-headed as he went, and try as we might, we
couldn't get anything reasonable out of him. He
talked a lot of gibberish about keelhauling and
walking the plank and crimson murders&mdash;things
which a decent sailor should know nothing about,
so that it seemed to me that for all his manners
captain had been more of a pirate than a gentleman
mariner. But to draw sense out of that boy was as
hard as picking cherries off a crab-tree. One silly
tale he had that he kept on drifting back to, and to
hear him you would have thought that it was the
only thing that happened to him in his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was at anchor,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;off an
island called the Basket of Flowers, and the sailors
had caught a lot of parrots and we were teaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
them to swear. Up and down the decks, up and
down the decks, and the language they used was
dreadful. Then we looked up and saw the masts of
the Spanish ship outside the harbor. Outside the
harbor they were, so we threw the parrots into the
sea, and sailed out to fight. And all the parrots
were drowneded in the sea, and the language they
used was dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That's the sort of boy he was&mdash;nothing but silly
talk of parrots when we asked him about the fighting.
And we never had a chance of teaching him
better, for two days after he ran away again, and
hasn't been seen since.</p>

<p>That's my story, and I assure you that things
like that are happening at Fairfield all the time.
The ship has never come back, but somehow, as
people grow older, they seem to think that one of
these windy nights she'll come sailing in over the
hedges with all the lost ghosts on board. Well,
when she comes, she'll be welcome. There's one
ghost lass that has never grown tired of waiting
for her lad to return. Every night you'll see her
out on the green, straining her poor eyes with looking
for the mast-lights among the stars. A faithful
lass you'd call her, and I'm thinking you'd be right.</p>

<p>Landlord's field wasn't a penny the worse for the
visit; but they do say that since then the turnips
that have been grown in it have tasted of rum.</p>

<h4>A CHRISTMAS STORY</h4>

<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> WALLACE IRWIN</h4>


<p>When Aunt Elizabeth asked me to spend Christmas
with her at Seven Oaks she appended a peculiar
request to her letter. &ldquo;Like a good fellow,&rdquo;
she wrote, &ldquo;won't you drop off at Perkinsville,
Ohio, on your way, and take a look at Gauntmoor
Castle? They say it's a wonderful old pile; and
its history is in many ways connected with that of
our own family. As long as you're the last of
the Geoffray Pierreponts, such things ought to interest
you.&rdquo; Like her auburn namesake who
bossed the Thames of yore, sweet, red-haired,
romantic autocrat, Aunt Elizabeth! Her wishes
were commands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is Aunt Elizabeth up to now?&rdquo;
I asked Tim Cole, my law partner, whom I found
in my rooms smoking my tobacco. &ldquo;Why should
I be inspecting Gauntmoor Castle&mdash;and what is a
castle named Gauntmoor doing in Perkinsville,
Ohio, anyway? Perkinsville sounds like the
Middle West, and Gauntmoor sounds like the
Middle Ages.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Right in both analyses,&rdquo; said the pipe-poaching
Tim. &ldquo;Castle Gauntmoor <i>is</i> from the Middle
Ages, and we all know about where in Ohio Perkinsville
is. But is it possible that you, twenty-seven
years old and a college graduate, haven't heard of
Thaddeus Hobson, the Marvelous Millionaire?&rdquo;
I shook my head. &ldquo;The papers have been full of
Hobson in the past two or three years,&rdquo; said Tim.
&ldquo;It was in 1898, I think, that Fate jumped Thaddeus
Hobson to the golden Olympus. He was first
head salesman in the village hardware store, then
he formulated so successful a scheme to clean up
the Tin Plate Combine that he put away a fabulous
number of millions in a year, and subsequently
went to England. Finally he set his heart on Norman
architecture. After a search he found the
ancient Castle Gauntmoor still habitable and for
sale. He thrilled the British comic papers by his
offer to buy the castle and move it to America.
Hobson saw the property, telegraphed to London,
and closed the deal in two hours. And an army of
laborers at once began taking the Gauntmoor to
pieces, stone by stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Transporting that relic to America involved
a cost in labor and ingenuity comparable with
nothing that has yet happened. Moving the Great
Pyramid would be a lighter job, perhaps. Thousands
of tons of scarred and medieval granite were
carried to the railroads, freighted to the sea, and
dragged across the Atlantic in whopping big
lighters chartered for the job. And the next the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
newspapers knew, the monster was set up in Perkinsville,
Ohio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did he do it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said Tim. &ldquo;Ingrowing sentiment&mdash;unlimited
capital&mdash;wanted to do something
for the Home Town, probably; wanted to
beautify the village that gave him his start&mdash;and
didn't know how to go at it. Well, so long!&rdquo; he
called out, as I seized my hat and streaked for the
train.</p>

<br />

<p>It was dinner time when the train pulled in at
Perkinsville. The town was as undistinguished as
I expected. I was too hungry to care about castles
at the moment, so I took the 'bus for the Commercial
Hotel, an establishment that seemed to
live up to its name, both in sentiment and in accommodation.
The landlord, Mr. Spike, referred
bitterly to the castle, which, he explained, was, by
its dominating presence, &ldquo;spoilin' the prosperous
appearance of Perkinsville.&rdquo; Dinner over, he led
me to a side porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How does Perkinsville look with that&mdash;with
that curio squattin' on top of it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Spike
sternly, as he pointed over the local livery stable,
over Smith Brothers' Plow Works, over Odd
Fellows' Hall, and up, up to the bleak hills beyond,
where, poised like a stony coronet on a giant's
brow, rose the great Norman towers and frowning
buttresses of Gauntmoor Castle. I rubbed my eyes.
No, it <i>couldn't</i> be real&mdash;it must be a wizard's work!</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What's old Hobson got out of it?&rdquo; said Mr.
Spike in my ear. &ldquo;Nothin' but an old stone barn,
where he can set all day nursin' a grouch and
keepin' his daughter Anita&mdash;they do say he does&mdash;under
lock and key for fear somebody's goin' to
marry her for her money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Spike looked up at the ramparts defiantly,
even as the Saxon churl must have gazed in an
earlier, far sadder land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's romantic,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>darn</i> rheumatic,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Spike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it open for visitors?&rdquo; I asked innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hobson?&rdquo; cackled Spike. &ldquo;He'd no more welcome
a stranger to that place than he'd welcome&mdash;a
ghost. He's a hol-ee terror, Hobson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Spike turned away to referee a pool game
down in the barroom.</p>

<p>The fires of a December sunset flared behind
Gauntmoor and cast the grim shadows of Medievalism
over Mediocrity, which lay below. Presently
the light faded, and I grew tired of gazing.
Since Hobson would permit no tourists to inspect
his castle, why was I here on this foolish trip?
Already I was planning to wire Aunt Elizabeth a
sarcastic reference to being marooned at Christmas
with a castle on my hands, when a voice at my
shoulder said suddenly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hobson sends his compliments, sir, and
wants to know would Mr. Pierrepont come up to
Gauntmoor for the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A groom in a plum-colored livery stood at my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
elbow. A light station wagon was waiting just
outside. How the deuce did Hobson know my
name? What did he want of me at Gauntmoor
this time of night? Yet prospects of bed and
breakfast away from the Commercial lured me
strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, Mr. Pierrepont will be delighted,&rdquo; I
announced, leaping into the vehicle, and soon we
were mounting upward, battling with the winds
around the time-scarred walls. The wagon stopped
at the great gate. A horn sounded from within,
the gate swung open, a drawbridge fell with a
hideous creaking of machinery, and we passed in,
twenty or thirty feet above the snow-drifted moat.
Beyond the portcullis a dim door swung open.
Some sort of seneschal met us with a light and led
us below the twilight arches, where beyond, I
could catch glimpses of the baileys and courts and
the donjon tower against the heavy ramparts.</p>

<p>The wind hooted through the high galleries as
we passed; but the west wing, from its many windows
and loopholes, blazed with cheerful yellow
light. It looked nearly cozy. Into a tall, gaunt
tower we plunged, down a winding staircase, and
suddenly we came into a vast hall, stately with
tapestries and innumerable monkish carvings&mdash;and
all brightly lighted with electricity!</p>

<p>A little fat man sat smoking in a chair near the
fire. When I entered he was in his shirt sleeves,
reading a newspaper, but when a footman announced
my name the little man, in a state of great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
nervousness, jumped to his feet and threw on a
coat, fidgeting painfully with the armholes. As he
came toward me, I noticed that he was perfectly
bald. He looked dyspeptic and discontented, like
a practical man trying vainly to adjust his busy
habits to a lazy life. Obviously he didn't go with
the rest of the furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleased to see you, Mr. Pierrepont,&rdquo; he said,
looking me over carefully as if he thought of buying
me. &ldquo;Geoffray Pierrepont&mdash;tut, tut!&mdash;ain't
it queer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer!&rdquo; I said rather peevishly. &ldquo;What's
queer about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, did I say queer? I didn't mean
to be impolite, sir&mdash;I was just thinking, that's
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You could hear the demon Army of the Winds
scaling the walls outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you thought it kind of abrupt, Mr.
Pierrepont, me asking you up here so unceremonious,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;My daughter Annie, she tells me
I ought to live up to the looks of the place; but I've
got my notions. To tell you the truth, I'm in an
awful quandary about this Antique Castle business
and when I heard you was at the hotel, I thought
you might help me out some way. You see you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led me to a chair and offered me a fat cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you get your
head above water and make good in the world&mdash;if
you ever do&mdash;don't fool with curios, don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
monkey with antiques. Keep away from castles.
They're like everything else sold by curio dealers&mdash;all
humbug. Look nice, yes. But get 'em over to
America and they either fall to pieces or the paint
comes off. Whether it's a chair or a castle&mdash;same
old story. The sly scalawags that sell you the
goods won't live up to their contracts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hasn't Gauntmoor all the ancient inconveniences
a Robber Baron could wish?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain't,&rdquo; announced Mr. Hobson. &ldquo;Though
it looks all right to a stranger, perhaps. There may
be castles in the Old World got it on Gauntmoor
for size&mdash;thank God I didn't buy 'em!&mdash;but for
looks you can't beat Gauntmoor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comfortable?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can't complain. Modern plumbed throughout.
Hard to heat, but I put an electric-light
plant in the cellar. Daughter Annie's got a Colonial
suite in the North Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I suggested, &ldquo;if there's anything the
castle lacks, you can buy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's one thing money <i>can't</i> buy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hobson, leaning very close and speaking in a sibilant
whisper. &ldquo;And that's ghosts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who wants ghosts?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobson. &ldquo;I'm a
business man. When I bought Gauntmoor, the
London scalawags that sold it to me gave me distinctly
to understand that this was a Haunted
Castle. They showed me a haunted chamber,
showed me the haunted wall where the ghost walks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
guaranteed the place to be the Spook Headquarters
of the British Isles&mdash;and see what I got!&rdquo; He
snapped his fingers in disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No results?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Results? Stung! I've slept in that haunted
room upstairs for a solid year. I've gazed night
after night over the haunted rampart. I've even
hired spiritualists to come and cut their didoes in
the towers and donjon keep. No use. You can't
get ghosts where they ain't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I expressed my sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm a plain man,&rdquo; said Hobson. &ldquo;I ain't got
any ancestors back of father, who was a blacksmith,
and a good one, when sober. Somebody else's
ancestors is what I looked for in this place&mdash;and
I've got 'em, too, carved in wood and stone in the
chapel out back of the tower. But statues and
carvings ain't like ghosts to add tone to an ancient
lineage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any legend?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't you heard it?&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking
at me sharply out of his small gray eyes. &ldquo;It
seems, 'way back in the sixteenth century, there
was a harum-scarum young feller living in a neighboring
castle, and he took an awful shine to Lady
Katherine, daughter of the Earl of Cummyngs,
who was boss of this place at that time. Now the
young man who loved Miss&mdash;I mean Lady&mdash;Katherine
was a sort of wild proposition. Old man
wouldn't have him around the place; but young
man kept hanging on till Earl ordered him off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Finally the old gent locked Lady Kitty in the donjon
tower,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much shilly-shallying in <i>this</i> generation,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;Every house that's got a pretty girl
ought to have a donjon keep. I've got both.&rdquo; He
paused and wiped his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This fresh young kid I'm telling you about,
he thought he knew more than the old folks, so he
got a rope ladder and climbed up the masonry one
night, intending to bust into the tower where the
girl was. But just as he got half across the wall&mdash;out
yonder&mdash;his foot slipped and he broke his neck
in the moat below. Consequence, Lady Kitty goes
crazy and old Earl found dead a week later in his
room. It was Christmas Eve when the boy was
killed. That's the night his ghost's supposed to
walk along the ramparts, give a shriek, and drop
off&mdash;but the irritating thing about it all is, it don't
ever happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Hobson,&rdquo; I said, throwing away
the butt of my cigar, &ldquo;why am <i>I</i> here? What have
<i>I</i> got to do with all this ghost business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>want</i> you to stay,&rdquo; said Hobson, beseechingly.
&ldquo;To-morrow night's Christmas Eve. I've figured it
out that your influence, somehow, you being of the
same blood, as it were, might encourage the ghost
to come out and save the reputation of the castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A servant brought candles, and Hobson turned
to retire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same blood!&rdquo; I shouted after him. &ldquo;What
on earth is the <i>name</i> of the ghost?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When he was alive his name was&mdash;Sir Geoffray
de Pierrepont,&rdquo; said Thaddeus Hobson, his figure
fading into the dimness beyond.</p>

<p>I followed the servant with the candle aloft
through chill and carven corridors, through galleries
lined with faded portraits of forgotten lords.
&ldquo;Wheels!&rdquo; I kept saying to myself. &ldquo;The old
man evidently thinks it takes a live Pierrepont to
coax a dead one,&rdquo; and I laughed nervously as I
entered the vast brown bedroom. I had to get
on a chair in order to climb into the four-poster, a
cheerful affair that looked like a royal funeral
barge. At my head I noticed a carved device,
seven mailed hands snatching at a sword with the
motto: &ldquo;CAVE ADSUM!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware, I am here!&rdquo; I translated. Who was
here? Ghosts? Fudge! What hideous scenes had
this chamber beheld of yore? What might not
happen here now? Where, by the way, was old
Hobson's daughter, Anita? Might not anything
be possible? I covered my head with the bedclothes.</p>

<br />

<p>Next morning being mild and bright for December,
and Thaddeus Hobson and his mysterious
daughter not having showed up for breakfast, I
amused myself by inspecting the exterior of the
castle. In daylight I could see that Gauntmoor, as
now restored, consisted of only a portion of the
original structure. On the west side, near a sheer
fall of forty or fifty feet, stood the donjon tower, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
fine piece of medieval barbarism with a peaked
roof. And, sure enough! I saw it all now. Running
along the entire west side of the castle was a
wonderful wall, stretching above the moat to a
dizzy height. It was no difficult matter to mount
this wall from the courtyard, above which it rose
no more than eight or ten feet. I ascended by a
rude sentry's staircase, and once on top I gazed
upward at the tall medieval prison-place, which
reared above me like a clumsy stone chimney.
Just as I stood, at the top of the wall, I was ten or
twelve feet below the lowest window of the donjon
tower. This, then, was the wall that the ancient
Pierrepont had scaled, and yonder was the donjon
window that he had planned to plunder on that
fatal night so long ago. And this was where Pierrepont
the Ghost was supposed to appear!</p>

<p>How the lover of spectral memory had managed
to scale that wall from the outside, I could not
quite make out. But once <i>on</i> the wall, it was no
trick to snatch the damsel from her durance vile.
Just drop a long rope ladder from the wall to the
moat, then crawl along the narrow ledge&mdash;got to
be careful with a job like that&mdash;then up to the
window of the donjon keep, and away with the
Lady Fair. Why, that window above the ramparts
would be an easy climb for a fellow with
strong arms and a little nerve, as the face of the
tower from the wall to the window was studded
with ancient spikes and the projecting ends of beams.</p>

<p>I counted the feet, one, two, three&mdash;and as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
looked up at the window, a small, white hand
reached out and a pink slip of paper dropped at
my feet. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I'm Miss Hobson. I'm locked in
the donjon tower. Father always locks me here
when there's a young man about. It's a horrid,
uncomfortable place. Won't you hurry and go?</p>

<center>Yours respectfully,</center>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span class="smcap">A. Hobson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>I knew it was easy. I swung myself aloft on the
spikes and stones leading to the donjon window.
When I was high enough I gazed in, my chin about
even with the sill. And there I saw the prettiest
girl I ever beheld, gazing down at a book tranquilly,
as though gentlemanly rescuers were common
as toads around that tower. She wore something
soft and golden; her hair was night-black,
and her eyes were that peculiar shade of gray that&mdash;but
what's the use?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; I said, holding on with my right
hand, lifting my hat with my left. &ldquo;Pardon, am
I addressing Miss Annie Hobson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not,&rdquo; she replied, only half looking up.
&ldquo;You are addressing Miss Anita Hobson. Calling
me Annie is another little habit father ought to
break himself of.&rdquo; She went on reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a very interesting book?&rdquo; I asked,
because I didn't like to go without saying something
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn't!&rdquo; She arose suddenly and hurled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
book into a corner. &ldquo;It's Anthony Hope&mdash;and if
there's anything I hate it's him. Father always
gives me <i>Prisoner of Zenda</i> and <i>Ivanhoe</i> to read
when he locks me into this donjon. Says I ought
to read up on the situation. Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some other books in the library,&rdquo; I
suggested. &ldquo;Bernard Shaw and Kipling, you
know. I'll run over and get you one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's fine&mdash;but no!&rdquo; she besought, reaching
out her hand to detain me. &ldquo;No, don't go! If you
went away you'd never come back. They never
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who never do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young men. The very instant father sees
one coming he pops me in the tower and turns the
key. You see,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;when I was in
Italy I was engaged to a duke&mdash;he was a silly little
thing and I was glad when he turned out bogus.
But father took the deception awfully to heart and
swore I should never be married for my money.
Yet I don't see what else a young girl can expect,&rdquo;
she added quite simply.</p>

<p>I could have mentioned several hundred things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has no right!&rdquo; I said sternly. &ldquo;It's barbarous
for him to treat a girl that way&mdash;especially
his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Dad's a good sort. But
you can't measure him by other people's standards.
And yet&mdash;oh, it's maddening, this life!
Day after day&mdash;loneliness. Nothing but stone
walls and rusty armor and books. We're rich, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
what do we get out of it? I have nobody of my
own age to talk to. How the years are passing!
After a while&mdash;I'll be&mdash;an old maid. I'm twenty-one
now!&rdquo; I heard a sob. Her pretty head was
bowed in her hands.</p>

<p>Desperately I seized the bars of the window and
miraculously they parted. I leaned across the sill
and drew her hands gently down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I break in and steal
you away from this, will you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt lives at Seven Oaks, less than an
hour from here by train. You can stay there till
your father comes to his reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's quite like father <i>never</i> to come to his reason,&rdquo;
she reflected. &ldquo;Then I should have to be
self-supporting. Of course, I should appreciate
employment in a candy shop&mdash;I think I know all
the principal kinds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied simply, &ldquo;I'll go. But how
can I get away from here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is Christmas Eve, when
Pierrepont the Ghost is supposed to walk along
the wall&mdash;right under this window. You don't
believe that fairy story, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I. But can't you see? The haunted
wall begins at my window on one end of the castle
and ends at your window on the other. The bars
of your cell, I see, are nearly all loose.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;I pried them out with a
pair of scissors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could hear Hobson's voice across the court
giving orders to servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father's coming. Remember to-night,&rdquo;
I whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Midnight,&rdquo; she said softly, smiling out at me.
I could have faced flocks and flocks of dragons for
her at that moment. The old man was coming
nearer. I swung to the ground and escaped into a
ruined court.</p>

<p>Well, the hours that followed were anxious and
busy for me. I worked in the glamour of romance
like a soldier about to do some particularly brave
and foolish thing. From the window of my room
I looked down on the narrow, giddy wall below.
It <i>was</i> a brave and foolish thing. Among the
rubbish in an old armory I found a coil of stout
rope, forty or fifty feet of it. This I smuggled
away. From a remote hall I borrowed a Crusader's
helmet and spent the balance of the afternoon in
my room practicing with a sheet across my shoulders,
shroud-fashion.</p>

<p>We dined grandly at eight, the old man and I.
He drank thirstily and chatted about the ghost, as
you might discuss the chances in a coming athletic
event. After what seemed an age he looked at his
watch and cried: &ldquo;Whillikens! Eleven o'clock
already! Well, I'll be going up to watch from the
haunted room. I think, Jeff, that you'll bring me
luck to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I shall!&rdquo; I answered sardonically, as
he departed.</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour later, wearing the
Crusader's helmet and swathed in a bedsheet, I
let myself down from the window to the haunted
wall below. It was moonlight, bitter cold as I
crouched on the wall, waiting for the stroke of
twelve, when I should act the spook and walk
along that precarious ledge to rescue Anita.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;haunted wall,&rdquo; I observed from where I
stood, was shaped like an irregular crescent, being
in plain view of Hobson's &ldquo;haunted room&rdquo; at the
middle, but not so at its north and south ends,
where my chamber and Anita's tower were respectively
situated. I pulled out my watch from under
my winding-sheet. Three minutes of twelve. I
drew down the vizor of my helmet and gathered up
my cerements preparatory to walking the hundred
feet of wall which would bring me in sight of the
haunted room where old Hobson kept his vigil.
Two minutes, one minute I waited, when&mdash;I
suddenly realized I was not alone.</p>

<p>A man wearing a long cloak and a feather in his
cap was coming toward me along the moonlit
masonry. Aha! So I was not the only masquerading
swain calling on the captive princess in the
prison tower. A jealous pang shot through me as
I realized this.</p>

<p>The man was within twenty feet of me, when I
noticed something. He was not walking on the
wall. <i>He was walking on air, three or four feet above
the wall.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> Nearer and nearer came the man&mdash;the
Thing&mdash;now into the light of the moon, whose
beams seemed to strike through his misty tissue
like the thrust of a sword. I was horribly scared.
My knees loosened under me, and I clutched the
vines at my back to save me from falling into the
moat below. Now I could see his face, and somehow
fear seemed to leave me. His expression was
so young and human.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghost of the Pierrepont,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;whether
you walk in shadow or in light, you lived among a
race of Men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His noble, pallid face seemed to burn with its
own pale light, but his eyes were in darkness. He
was now within two yards of me. I could see the
dagger at his belt. I could see the gory cut on his
forehead. I attempted to speak, but my voice
creaked like a rusty hinge. He neither heeded nor
saw me; and when he came to the spot where I
stood, he did not turn out for me. He walked
<i>through</i> me! And when next I saw him he was a
few feet beyond me, standing in mid-air over the
moat and gazing up at the high towers like one
revisiting old scenes. Again he floated toward me
and poised on the wall four feet from where I stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you here to-night?&rdquo; suddenly spoke,
or seemed to speak, a voice that was like the echo
of a silence.</p>

<p>No answer came from my frozen tongue. Yet I
would gladly have spoken, because somehow I felt
a great sympathy for this boyish spirit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been many earth-years,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since
I have walked these towers. And ah, cousin, it
has been many miles that I have been called to-night
to answer the summons of my race. And this
fortress&mdash;what power has moved it overseas to this
mad kingdom? Magic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His eyes seemed suddenly to blaze through the
shadows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cousin,&rdquo; he again spoke, &ldquo;it is to you that I
come from my far-off English tomb. It was your
need called me. It is no pious deed brings you to
this wall to-night. You are planning to pillage
these towers unworthily, even as I did yesterday.
Death was my portion, and broken hearts to the
father I wronged and the girl I sought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is the father wrongs the girl here,&rdquo; I
heard myself saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He who rules these towers to-day is of stern
mind but loving heart,&rdquo; said the ghost. &ldquo;Patience.
By the Star that redeems the world, love
should not be won <i>to-night</i> by stealth, but by&mdash;love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his hands toward the tower, his countenance
radiant with an undying passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> called to me and died,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and her
little ghost comes not to earth again for any winter
moon or any summer wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;you come often?&rdquo; my voice was
saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the ghost, &ldquo;only on Christmas Eve.
Yule is the tide of specters; for then the thoughts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of the world are so beautiful that they enter our
dreams and call us back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to go, and a boyish, friendly smile
rested a moment on his pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell, Sir Geoffray de Pierrepont,&rdquo; he
called to me.</p>

<p>Into the misty moonlight the ghost floated to
that portion of the wall directly opposite the
haunted room. From where I stood I could not
see this chamber. After a moment I shook my
numb senses to life. My first instinct was one of
strong human curiosity, which impelled me to follow
far enough to see the effect of the apparition on
old Hobson, who must be watching at the window.</p>

<p>I tiptoed a hundred feet along the wall and
peered around a turret up to a room above, where
Hobson's head could easily be seen in a patch of
light. The ghost, at that moment, was walking
just below, and the effect on the old man, appalling
though it was, was ludicrous as well. He was
leaning far out of the window, his mouth wide
open; and the entire disk of his fat, hairless head
was as pallid as the moon itself. The specter, who
was now rounding the curve of the wall near the
tower, swerved suddenly, and as suddenly seemed
to totter headlong into the abyss below. As he
dropped, a wild laugh broke through the frosty air.
It wasn't from the ghost. It came from above&mdash;yes,
it emanated from Thaddeus Hobson, who had,
apparently, fallen back, leaving the window empty.
Lights began breaking out all over the castle. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
another moment I should be caught in my foolish
disguise. With the courage of a coward, I turned
and ran full tilt along the dizzy ledge and back to
my window, where I lost no seconds scrambling up
the rope that led to my room.</p>

<p>With all possible haste I threw aside my sheet
and helmet and started downstairs. I had just
wrestled with a ghost; I would now have it out
with the old man. The castle seemed ablaze below.
I saw the flash of a light skirt in the picture gallery,
and Anita, pale as the vision I had so lately beheld,
came running toward me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;saw it!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;He had some
sort of sinking spell&mdash;he's better now&mdash;isn't it
awful!&rdquo; She clung to me, sobbing hysterically.</p>

<p>Before I realized what I had done, I was holding
her close in my arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;It was a good ghost&mdash;he
had a finer spirit than mine. He came to-night
for you, dear, and for me. It was a foolish thing
we planned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I wanted, I wanted to go!&rdquo; she sobbed
now crying frankly on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> going with me,&rdquo; I said fiercely, raising
her head. &ldquo;But not over any ghost-ridden breakneck
wall. We're going this time through the big
front door of this old castle, American fashion, and
there'll be an automobile waiting outside and a
parson at the other end of the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We found Thaddeus Hobson alone, in the vast
hall looking blankly at the fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Jeff,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;you sure brought me
luck to-night if you can call it such being scared
into a human icicle. Br-r-r! Shall I ever get the
cold out of my backbone? But somehow, somehow
that foggy feller outside sort of changed my
look on things. It made me feel <i>kinder</i> toward
living folks. Ain't it strange!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hobson,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think the ghost has
made us <i>all</i> see things differently. In a word, sir,
I have a confession to make&mdash;if you don't mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I told him briefly of my accidental meeting
with Anita in the donjon, of the practical joke we
planned, of our sudden meeting with the <i>real</i> ghost
on the ramparts. Mr. Hobson listened, his face
growing redder and redder. At the finish of my
story he suddenly leaped to his feet and brought
his fist down on the table with a bang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you little devils!&rdquo; he said admiringly,
and burst into loud laughter. &ldquo;You're a spunky
lad, Jeff. And there ain't any doubt that the de
Pierreponts are as good stuff as you can get in the
ancestry business. The Christmas supper is spread
in the banquet hall. Come, de Pierrepont, will you
sup with the old Earl?&rdquo;</p>

<br />

<p>The huge oaken banquet hall, lined with rich
hangings, shrunk us to dwarfs by its vastness.
Golden goblets were at each place. A butler,
dressed in antique livery, threw a red cloak over
Hobson's fat shoulders. It was a whim of the old
man's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>As we took our places, I noticed the table was
set for four.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose is the extra place?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>The old man at first made no reply. At last he
turned to me earnestly and said: &ldquo;Do you believe
in ghosts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Yet how else can I explain
that vision I saw on the ramparts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the fourth place for him?&rdquo; Anita almost
whispered.</p>

<p>The old man nodded mutely and raised a golden
goblet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the Transplanted Ghost!&rdquo; I said. It was
an empty goblet that I touched to my lips.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> NELSON LLOYD</h4>


<p>From his perch on the blacksmith's anvil he
spoke between the puffs of his post-prandial pipe.
The fire in the forge was out and the day was going
slowly, through the open door of the shop and the
narrow windows, westward to the mountains. In
the advancing shadow, on the pile of broken wheels
on the work-bench, on keg and barrel, they sat
puffing their post-prandial pipes and listening.</p>

<br />

<p>For a partner in business I want a truthful man,
but for a companion give me one with imagination.
To my mind imagination is the spice of life. There
is nothing so uninteresting as a fact, for when you
know it that is the end of it. When life becomes
nothing but facts it won't be worth living; yet in
a few years the race will have no imagination left.
It is being educated out. Look at the children.
When I was young the bogey man was as real to
me as pa and nearly as much to be feared of, but
just yesterday I was lectured for merely mentioning
him to my neffy. So with ghosts. We was
taught to believe in ghosts the same as we was in
Adam or Noar. Nowadays nobody believes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
them. It is unscientific, and if you are superstitious
you are considered ignorant and laughed at.
Ghosts are the product of the imagination, but if I
imagine I see one he is as real to me as if he actually
exists, isn't he? Therefore he does exist. That's
logic. You fellows have become scientific and
admits only what you see and feel, and don't depend
on your imagination for anything. Such
being the case, I myself admit that the sperrits no
longer ha'nt the burying-ground or play around
your houses. I admit it because the same condition
exact existed in Harmony when I was there,
and because of what was told me by Robert J.
Dinkle about two years after he died, and because
of what occurred between me and him and the
Rev. Mr. Spiegelnail.</p>

<p>Harmony was a highly intellectual town. About
the last man there with any imagination or interesting
ideas, excepting me, of course, was
Robert J. Dinkle. Yet he had an awful reputation,
and when he died it was generally stated privately
that the last landmark of ignorance and superstition
had been providentially removed. You know
he had always been seeing things, but we set it
down to his fondness for hard cider or his natural
prepensity for joshing. With him gone there was
no one left to report the doings of the sperrit-world.
In fact, so widespread was the light of
reason, as the Rev. Mr. Spiegelnail called it, that
the burying-ground became a popular place for
moonlight strolls. Even I walked through it frequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
on my way home from Miss Wheedle's, with
whom I was keeping company, and it never
occurred to me to go any faster there, or to look
back over my shoulder, for I didn't believe in such
foolishness. But to the most intellectual there
comes times of doubt about things they know
nothing of nor understand. Such a time come to
me, when the wind was more mournfuller than
usual in the trees, and the clouds scudded along
overhead, casting peculiar shadders. My imagination
got the best of my intellect. I hurried. I
looked back over my shoulder. I shivered, kind of.
Natural I see nothing in the burying-ground, yet
at the end of town I was still uneasy-like, though
half laughing at myself. It was so quiet; not a
light burned anywhere, and the square seemed
lonelier than the cemetery, and the store was so
deserted, so ghostly in the moonlight, that I just
couldn't keep from peering around at it.</p>

<p>Then, from the empty porch, from the empty
bench&mdash;empty, I swear, for I could see plain, so
clear was the night&mdash;from absolute nothing come
as pleasant a voice as ever I hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; it says.</p>

<p>My blood turned icy-like and the chills waved
up and down all through me. I couldn't move.</p>

<p>The voice came again, so natural, so familiar,
that I warmed some, and rubbed my eyes and
stared.</p>

<p>There, sitting on the bench, in his favorite place,
was the late Robert J. Dinkle, gleaming in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
moonlight, the front door showing right through
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must appear pretty distinct,&rdquo; he says in a
proud-like way. &ldquo;Can't you see me very plain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>See him plain! I should think so. Even the
patches on his coat was visible, and only for the
building behind him, he never looked more natural,
and hearing him so pleasant, set me thinking.
This, says I, is the sperrit of the late Robert J.
Dinkle. In life he never did me any harm and in
his present misty condition is likely to do less; if
he is looking for trouble I'm not afraid of a bit
of fog. Such being the case, I says, I shall address
him as soon as I am able.</p>

<p>But Robert got tired waiting, and spoke again
in an anxious tone, a little louder, and ruther complaining,
&ldquo;Don't I show up good?&rdquo; says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see you looking better,&rdquo; I answered,
for my voice had came back, and the chills were
quieter, and I was fairly ca'm and dared even to
move a little nearer.</p>

<p>A bright smile showed on his pale face. &ldquo;It is a
relief to be seen at last,&rdquo; he cried, most cheerful.
&ldquo;For years I've been trying to do a little ha'nting
around here, and no one would notice me. I used
to think mebbe my material was too delicate and
gauzy, but I've conceded that, after all, the stuff is
not to blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heaved a sigh so natural that I forgot all
about his being a ghost. Indeed, taken all in all, I
see that he had improved, was solemner, had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
sweeter expression and wasn't likely to give in to
his old prepensity for joshing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set down and we will talk it over,&rdquo; he went on
most winning. &ldquo;Really, I can't do any harm, but
please be a little afraid and then I will show up
distincter. I must be getting dim now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; says I, for though I was on the porch
edging nearer him most bold, I could hardly see
him.</p>

<p>Without any warning he gave an awful groan
that brought the chills waving back most violent.
I jumped and stared, and as I stared he stood out
plainer and solider in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's better,&rdquo; he said with a jolly chuckle;
&ldquo;now you do believe in me, don't you? Well, set
there nervous-like, on the edge of the bench and
don't be too ca'm-like, or I'll disappear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost's orders were followed explicit. But
with him setting there so natural and pleasant it
was hard to be frightened and more than once I
forgot. He, seeing me peering like my eyesight
was bad, would give a groan that made my blood
curdle. Up he would flare again, gleaming in the
moonlight full and strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harmony's getting too scientific, too intellectual,&rdquo;
he said, speaking very melancholic. &ldquo;What
can't be explained by arithmetic or geography is
put down as impossible. Even the preachers encourage
such idees and talk about Adam and Eve
being allegories. As a result, the graveyard has
become the slowest place in town. You simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
can't ha'nt anything around here. A man hears a
groan in his room and he gets up and closes the
shutters tighter, or throws a shoe at a rat, or swears
at the wind in the chimney. A few sperrits were
hanging around when I was first dead, but they
were complaining very bad about the hard times.
There used to be plenty of good society in the burying-ground,
they said, but one by one they had to
quit. All the old Berrys had left. Mr. Whoople
retired when he was taken for a white mule. Mrs.
Morris A. Klump, who once oppyrated 'round the
deserted house beyond the mill had gave up in
disgust just a week before my arrival. I tried to
encourage the few remaining, explained how the
sperritualists were working down the valley and
would strike town any time, but they had lost all
hope&mdash;kept fading away till only me was left. If
things don't turn for the better soon I must go,
too. It's awful discouraging. And lonely! Why
folks ramble around the graves like even I wasn't
there. Just last night my boy Ossy came strolling
along with the lady he is keeping company with,
and where do you s'pose they set down to rest, and
look at the moon and talk about the silliest subjecks?
Right on my headstone! I stood in front
of them and did the ghostliest things till I was clean
tired out and discouraged. They just would not
pay the least attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor old ghost almost broke down and
cried. Never in life had I known him so much
affected, and it went right to my heart to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
him wiping his eyes with his handkercher and
snuffling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you don't make enough noise when you
ha'nt,&rdquo; says I most sympathetic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do all the regular acts,&rdquo; says he, a bit het up
by my remark. &ldquo;We always were kind of limited.
I float around and groan, and talk foolish, and
sometimes I pull off bedclothes or reveal the hiding-place
of buried treasure. But what good does it do
in a town so intellectual as Harmony?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have seen many folks who were down on their
luck, but never one who so appealed to me as the
late Robert J. Dinkle. It was the way he spoke,
the way he looked, his general patheticness, his
very helplessness, and deservingness. In life I had
known him well, and as he was now I liked him
better. So I did want to do something for him.
We sat studying for a long time, him smoking very
violent, blowing clouds of fog outen his pipe, me
thinking up some way to help him. And idees
allus comes to them who sets and waits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is partly as you say, Robert,&rdquo; I
allowed after a bit, &ldquo;and again partly because you
can't make enough noise to awaken the slumbering
imagination of intellectual Harmony. With a little
natural help from me though, you might stir things
up in this town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You never saw a gladder smile or a more gratefuller
look than that poor sperrit gave me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with your help I could do
wonders. Now who'll we begin on?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Spiegelnail,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;has about
all the imagination left in Harmony&mdash;of course
excepting me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert's face fell visible. &ldquo;I have tried him
repeated and often,&rdquo; he says, kind of argumentative-like.
&ldquo;All the sign he made was to complain
that his wife talked in her sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wasn't going to argue&mdash;not me. I was all for
action, and lost no time in starting. Robert J., he
followed me like a dog, up through town to our
house, where I went in, leaving him outside so as
not to disturb mother. There I got me a hammer
and nails with the heavy lead sinker offen my fishnet,
and it wasn't long before the finest tick-tack
you ever saw was working against the Spiegelnails'
parlor window, with me in a lilac-bush operating
the string that kept the weight a-swinging. Before
the house was an open spot where the moon shone
full and clear, where Robert J. walked up and
down, about two feet off the ground, waving his
arms slow-like and making the melancholiest
groans. Now I have been to <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>
frequent, but in all my life I never see such acting.
Yet what was the consequences? Up went the
window above, and the Rev. Mr. Spiegelnail
showed out plain in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he called very stern. You had
otter see Robert then. It was like tonic to him.
He rose up higher and began to beat his arms most
violent and to gurgle tremendous. But the
preacher never budged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You boys otter be ashamed of yourselves,&rdquo;
he says in a severe voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Louder, louder,&rdquo; I calls to Robert J., in answering
which he began the most awful contortions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can hear me perfectly plain,&rdquo; says the
dominie, now kind of sad-like. &ldquo;It fills my old
heart with sorrow to see that yous all have gone
so far astray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing that, so calm, so distinct, so defiant,
made Robert J. stop short and stare. To remind
him I gave the weight an extra thump, and it was
so loud as to bring forth Mrs. Spiegelnail, her head
showing plain as she peered out over the preacher's
shoulder. The poor discouraged ghost took heart,
striking his tragicest attitude, one which he told
me afterwards was his pride and had been got out
of a book. But what was the result?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does you hear anyone in the bushes, dear?&rdquo;
inquires Mr. Spiegelnail, cocking his ears and
listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be Ossy Dinkle and them bad friends
of his,&rdquo; says she, in her sour tone.</p>

<p>Poor Robert! Hearing that, he about gave up
hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't I show up good?&rdquo; he asks in an anxious
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see you distinct,&rdquo; says I, very sharp.
&ldquo;You never looked better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down went the window&mdash;so sudden, so unexpected
that I did not know what to make of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Robert J. thought he did, and over me he came
floating, most delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have worked,&rdquo; he said, laughing like
he'd die, a-doubling up and holding his sides to
keep from splitting. &ldquo;At last I have showed up
distinct; at last I am of some use in the world.
You don't realize what a pleasure it is to know
that you are fulfilling your mission and living up
to your reputation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor old ghost! He was for talking it all over
then and there and settled down on a soft bunch of
lilacs, and fell to smoking fog and chattering. It
did me good to see him so happy and I was inclined
to puff up a bit at my own success in the ha'nting
line. But it was not for long. The rattle of keys
warned us. The front door flew open and out
bounded the Rev. Mr. Spiegelnail, clearing the
steps with a jump, and flying over the lawn. All
thought of the late Robert J. Dinkle left me then,
for I had only a few feet start of my pastor. You
see I shouldn't a-hurried so only I sung bass in the
choir and I doubt if I could have convinced him
that I was working in the interests of Science and
Truth. Fleeing was instinct. Gates didn't matter.
They were took on the wing, and down the street
I went with the preacher's hot breath on my neck.
But I beat him. He tired after the first spurt
and was soon left behind, so I could double back
home to bed.</p>

<p>Robert, he was for giving up entirely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I simply won't work,&rdquo; says he to me, when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
met him on the store porch that next night. &ldquo;A
hundred years ago such a bit of ha'nting would
have caused the town to be abandoned; to-day it is
attributed to natural causes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;we left behind such evidences
of material manifestations as strings and
weights on the parlor window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S'pose we work right in the house?&rdquo; says he,
brightening up. &ldquo;You can hide in the closet and
groan while I act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now did you ever hear anything innocenter than
that? Yet he meant it so well I did not even laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm too fond of my pastor,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;to let him
catch me in his closet. A far better spot for our
work is the short cut he takes home from church
after Wednesday evening meeting. We won't be
so loud, but more dignified, melancholier, and
tragic. You overacted last night, Robert,&rdquo; I says.
&ldquo;Next time pace up and down like you were deep
in thought and sigh gentle. Then if he should see
you it would be nice to take his arm and walk
home with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think I had the right idea of ha'nting, and had
I been able to keep up Robert J. Dinkle's sperrits
and to train him regular I could have aroused the
slumbering imagination of Harmony, and brought
life to the burying-ground. But he was too easy
discouraged. He lacked perseverance. For if ever
Mr. Spiegelnail was on the point of seeing things
it was that night as he stepped out of the woods.
He had walked slow and meditating till he come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
opposite where I was. Now I didn't howl or groan
or say anything particular. What I did was to
make a noise that wasn't animal, neither was it
human, nor was it regulation ghostly. As I had
stated to the late Robert J. Dinkle, what was
needed for ha'nting was something new and original.
And it certainly ketched Mr. Spiegelnail's
attention. I see him stop. I see his lantern shake.
It appeared like he was going to dive into the
bushes for me, but he changed his mind. On he
went, quicker, kind as if he wasn't afraid, yet was,
on to the open, where the moon brought out Robert
beautiful as he paced slowly up and down, his head
bowed like he was studying. Still the preacher
never saw him, stepped right through him, in fact.
I give the dreadful sound again. That stopped
him. He turned, raised the lantern before him, put
his hand to his ear, and seemed to be looking intense
and listening. Hardly ten feet away stood
Robert, all a-trembling with excitement, but the
light that showed through him was as steady as a
rock, as the dominie watched and listened, so quiet
and ca'm. He lowered the lantern, rubbed his
hands across his eyes, stepped forward and looked
again. The ghost was perfect. As I have stated,
he was excited and his sigh shook a little, but he
was full of dignity and sadity. He shouldn't have
lost heart so soon. I was sure then that he almost
showed up plain to the preacher and he would have
grown on Mr. Spiegelnail had he kept on ha'nting
him instead of giving in because that one night the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
pastor walked on to the house fairly cool. He did
walk quicker, I know, and he did peer over his
shoulder twicet and I did hear the kitchen door
bang in a relieved way. But when we consider the
stuff that ghosts are made of we hadn't otter expect
them to be heroes. They are too foggy and
gauzy to have much perseverance&mdash;judging at
least from Robert J.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I simply can't work any more,&rdquo; says he, when
I came up to him, as he sat there in the path, his
elbows on his knees, his head on his hands, his eyes
studying the ground most mournful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Robert&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began, thinking to cheer
him up.</p>

<p>He didn't hear; he wouldn't listen&mdash;just faded
away.</p>

<p>Had he only held out there is no telling what he
might have done in his line. Often, since then,
have I thought of him and figgered on his tremendous
possibilities. That he had possibilities I am
sure. Had I only realized it that last night we
went out ha'nting, he never would have got away
from me. But the realization came too late. It
came in church the very next Sunday, with the
usual announcements after the long prayer, as Mr.
Spiegelnail was leaning over the pulpit eying the
congregation through big smoked glasses.</p>

<p>Says he in a voice that was full of sadness: &ldquo;I
regret to announce that for the first time in twenty
years union services will be held in this town next
Sabbath.&rdquo; Setting in the choir, reading my music<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
marks, I heard the preacher's words and started,
for I saw at once that something unusual was
happening, or had happened, or was about to
happen. &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Mr. Spiegelnail,
continuing, &ldquo;I shall have to turn my pulpit over
to Brother Spiker of the Baptist Church, for my
failing eyesight renders it necessary that I go at
once to Philadelphia, to consult an oculist. Some
of my dear brethren may think this an unusual
step, but I should not desert them without cause.
They may think, perhaps, that I am making much
ado about nothing and could be treated just as
well in Harrisburg. To such let me explain that I
am suffering from astigmatism. It is not so much
that I cannot see, but that I sees things which I
know are not there&mdash;a defect in sight which I feel
needs the most expert attention. Sunday-school
at half-past nine; divine service at eleven. I take
for my text 'And the old men shall see visions.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>How I did wish the late Robert J. Dinkle could
have been in church that morning. It would have
so gladdened his heart to hear that he had partly
worked, for if he worked partly, then surely, in
time, he would have worked complete. For me, I
was just wild with excitement, and was so busy
thinking of him and how glad he would be, that I
didn't hear the sermon at all, and in planning new
ways of ha'nting I forgot to sing in the last anthem.
You see, I figgered lively times ahead for Harmony&mdash;a
general return to the good old times when folks
had imagination and had something more in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
heads than facts. I had only to get Robert again,
and with him working it would not be long till all
the old Berrys and Mrs. Klump showed up distinct
and plain. But I wasn't well posted in the weak
characters of shades, for I thought, of course, I
could find my sperrit friend easy when night came.
Yet I didn't. I set on the store porch shivering till
the moon was high up over the ridge. He just
wouldn't come. I called for him soft-like and got
no answer. Down to the burying-ground I went
and set on his headstone. It was the quietest place
you ever see. The clouds was scudding overhead;
the wind was sighing among the leaves; and
through the trees the moon was gleaming so clear
and distinct you could almost read the monnyments.
It was just a night when things should
have been lively there&mdash;a perfect night for ha'nting.
I called for Robert. I listened. He never
answered. I heard only a bull-frog a-bellering in

<p>Penniless and proud he was; and that pair
don't draw a man to pleasant places when they
be in double harness. There's only one thing can
stop 'em if they take the bit between their teeth,
and that's a woman. So there, you might say, lies
the text of the tale of Jonathan Drake, of Dunnabridge
Farm, a tenement in the Forest of Dartymoor.
'Twas Naboth's vineyard to Duchy, and
the greedy thing would have given a very fair price
for it, without a doubt; but the Drake folk held
their land, and wouldn't part with it, and boasted
a freehold of fifty acres in the very midst of the
Forest. They did well, too, and moved with the
times, and kept their heads high for more generations
than I can call home; and then they comed to
what all families, whether gentle or simple, always
come to soon or late. And that's a black sheep for
bell-wether. Bad uns there'll be in every generation
of a race; but the trouble begins when a bad
un chances to be up top; and if the head of the
family is a drunkard, or a spendthrift, or built on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
too free and flowing a pattern for this work-a-day
shop, then the next generation may look out for
squalls, as the sailor-men say.</p>

<p>'Twas Jonathan's grandfather that did the harm
at Dunnabridge. He had sport in his blood, on
his mother's side, and 'twas horses ran him into
trouble. He backed 'em, and was ruined; and then
his son bred 'em, and didn't do very much better.
So, when the pair of 'em dropped out of the hunt,
and died with their backs to the wall, one after
t'other, it looked as if the game was up for them to
follow. By good chance, however, Tom Drake had
but one child&mdash;a boy&mdash;the Jonathan as I be telling
about; and when his father and grandfather passed
away, within a year of each other, Dunnabridge
was left to Tom's widow and her son, him then
being twenty-two. She was for selling Dunnabridge
and getting away from Dartymoor, because
the place had used her bad, and she hated the
sight of it; but Jonathan, a proud chap even then,
got the lawyers to look into the matter, and they
told him that 'twasn't vital for Dunnabridge to be
sold, though it might ease his pocket, and smooth
his future to do so, 'specially as Duchy wanted the
place rather bad, and had offered the value of it.
And Jonathan's mother was on the side of Duchy,
too, and went on her knees to the man to sell; but
he wouldn't. He had a bee in his bonnet sometimes,
and he said that all the Drakes would rise
out of their graves to Widecombe churchyard, and
haunt his rising up and going down if he were to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
such a thing, just to suit his own convenience, and
be rid of the place. So he made a plan with the
creditors. It figured out that his father and grandfather
had owed near a thousand pound between
them; and Jonathan actually set himself to pay it
off to the last penny. 'Twas the labor of years;
but by the time he was thirty-three he done it&mdash;at
what cost of scrimping and screwing, only his
mother might have told. She never did tell, however,
for she died two year before the last item was
paid. Some went as far as to declare that 'twas
her son's miserly ways hurried her into her grave;
and, for all I know, they may have done so, for 'tis
certain, in her husband's life, she had a better time.
Tom was the large-hearted, juicy, easy sort, as
liked meat on the table, and plenty to wash it
down; and he loved Mercy Jane Drake very well;
and, when he died, the only thought that troubled
him was leaving her; and the last thing he advised
his son was to sell Dunnabridge, and take his
mother off the Moor down to the &ldquo;in country&rdquo;
where she'd come from.</p>

<p>But Jonathan was made of different stuff, and
'twas rumored by old people that had known the
family for several generations that he favored an
ancient forefather by name of Brimpson Drake.
This bygone man was a miser and the richest of
the race. He'd lived in the days when we were at
war with France and America, and when Princetown
sprang up, and a gert war-prison was built
there to cage all the chaps we got on our hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
through winning such a lot o' sea battles. And
Miser Brimpson was said to have made thousands
by helping rich fellows to escape from the prison.
Truth and falsehood mixed made up his story as
'twas handed down. But one thing appeared to
be fairly true about it; which was, that when the
miser died, and Dunnabridge went to his cousin,
the horseracer, not a penny of his fortune ever came
into the sight of living men. So some said 'twas all
nonsense, and he never had no money at all, but
only pretended to it; and others again, declared
that he knew too well who'd follow in his shoes at
Dunnabridge, and hid his money accordingly, so
that no Drake should have it. For he hated his
heirs as only a miser can hate 'em.</p>

<p>So things stood when Mercy Jane died and
Jonathan was left alone. He paid all his relations'
debts, and he had his trouble and the honor of
being honorable for his pains. Everybody respected
him something wonderful; but, all the same,
a few of his mother's friends always did say that
'twas a pity he put his dead father's good name
afore his living mother's life. However, we'm not
built in the pattern of our fellow-creatures, and 'tis
only fools that waste time blaming a man for being
himself.</p>

<p>Jonathan went his stern way; and then, in the
lonely days after his parent was taken, when he
lived at Dunnabridge, with nought but two hinds
and a brace of sheep-dogs, 'twas suddenly borne
in upon his narrow sight that there might be other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
women still in the world, though his mother had
gone out of it. And he also discovered, doubtless,
that a home without a woman therein be merely
the cruel mockery of what a home should be.</p>

<p>A good few folk watched Jonathan to see what
he'd do about it, and no doubt a maiden here and
there was interested too; because, though a terrible
poor man, he wasn't bad to look at, though rather
hard about the edge of the jaw, and rather short
and stern in his manners to human creatures and
beasts alike.</p>

<p>And then beginned his funny courting&mdash;if you
can call it courting, where a poor man allows hisself
the luxury of pride at the wrong time, and
makes a show of hisself in consequence. At least
that's my view; but you must know that a good
few, quite as wise as me, took t'other side, and held
that Jonathan covered his name with glory when
he changed his mind about Hyssop Burges. That
was her bitter name, but a pleasanter girl never
walked on shoe-leather. She was Farmer Stonewer's
niece to White Works, and he took her in
for a charity, and always said that 'twas the best
day's work as ever he had done. A straight, hardworking,
cheerful sort of a girl, with nothing to
name about her very special save a fine shape and
a proud way of holding her head in the air and
looking her fellow creatures in the eyes. Proud
she was for certain, and terrible partickler as to her
friends; but there happened to be that about Jonathan
that made flint to her steel. He knowed she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was penniless, or he'd not have looked at her twice;
and when, after a short, fierce sort of courting, she
took him, everybody felt pleased about it but
Farmer Stonewer, who couldn't abide the thought
of losing Hyssop, though his wife had warned him
any time this four year that 'twas bound to happen.</p>

<p>Farmer and the girl were sitting waiting for
Jonathan one night; and she was a bit nervous,
and he was trying for to calm her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jonathan must be told,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It can't
go on no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell him,&rdquo; says her uncle. &ldquo;Good
powers!&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;to see you, one would think
the news was the worst as could ever fall between
a pair o' poor lovers, instead of the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know him a lot better than you,&rdquo; she tells
Farmer; &ldquo;and I know how plaguey difficult he
can be where money's the matter. He very near
throwed me over when, in a weak moment, I axed
him to let me buy my own tokening-ring. Red as
a turkey's wattles did he flame, and said I'd insulted
him; and now, when he hears the secret, I
can't for the life of me guess how he'll take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Twas a pity you didn't tell him when he
offered for you,&rdquo; declared Hyssop's aunt. &ldquo;Proud
he is as a silly peacock, and terrible frightened of
seeming to look after money, or even casting his
eye where it bides; but he came to you without any
notion of the windfall, and he loved you for yourself,
like an honest man; and you loved him the
same way; and right well you know that if your old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
cousin had left you five thousand pound instead of
five hundred, Jonathan Drake was the right chap
for you. He can't blame himself, for not a soul on
Dartymoor but us three has ever heard tell about
the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he'll blame me for having money at all,&rdquo;
answered the girl. &ldquo;He said a dozen times afore
he offered for me, that he'd never look at a woman
if she'd got more cash than what he had himself.
That's why I couldn't bring myself to confess to it&mdash;and
lose him. And, after we was tokened, it got
to be harder still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not bide till you'm married, then?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Stonewer. &ldquo;Since it have gone so long, let it
go longer, and surprise him with the news on the
wedding-night&mdash;eh, James?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Farmer. &ldquo;'Enough is as good
as a feast.' 'Tis squandering blessings to do that
at such a time. Keep the news till some rainy
day, when he's wondering how to get round a tight
corner. That's the moment to tell him; and that's
the moment he's least likely to make a face at the
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Hyssop wouldn't put it off no more; she
said as she'd not have any further peace till the
murder was out. And that very night, sure enough
when Jonathan comed over from Dunnabridge for
his bit of love-making, and the young couple had
got the farm parlor to themselves, she plumped it
out, finding him in a very kindly mood. They
never cuddled much, for he wasn't built that way;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
but he'd not disdain to sit beside her and put his
arm around her now and again, when she picked
up his hand and drew it round. Then, off and on,
she'd rub her cheek against his mutton-chop
whiskers, till he had to kiss her in common politeness.</p>

<p>Well, Hyssop got it out&mdash;Lord alone knows how,
as she said afterwards. She got it out, and told
him that an old, aged cousin had died, and left
her a nice little skuat<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of money; and how she'd
never touched a penny but let it goody in the bank;
and how she prayed and hoped 'twould help 'em to
Dunnabridge; and how, of course, he must have
the handling of it, being a man, and so cruel clever
in such things. She went on and on, pretty well
frightened to stop and hear him. But, after she'd
said it over about a dozen times, her breath failed
her, and she shut her mouth, and tried to smile,
and looked up terrible anxious and pleading at
Jonathan.</p>

<p>His hard gray eyes bored into her like a brace of
gimlets, and in return for all her talk he axed but
one question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you had this here money?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>She told the truth, faltering and shaking under
his glare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four years and upwards, Jonathan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's years and years afore I axed you to
marry me?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jonathan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you remember what I said about never
marrying anybody as had more than what I have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jonathan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you full know how many a time I told you
that, after I paid off all my father's debts, I had
nought left, and 'twould be years afore I could
build up anything to call money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jonathan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo; he cried out, and his brow
crooked down and his fists clenched. &ldquo;Very well,
you've deceived me deliberate, and if you'd do
that in one thing, you would in another. I'm
going out of this house this instant moment, and
you can tell your relations why 'tis. I'm terrible
sorry, Hyssop Burges, for no man will ever love
you better than what I did; and so you'd have
lived to find out when all this here courting tomfoolery
was over, and you'd come to be my wife.
But now I'll have none of you, for you've played with
me. And so&mdash;so I'll bid you good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went straight out without more speech; and
she tottered, weeping, to her uncle and aunt.
They couldn't believe their senses; and Jimmy
Stonewer declared thereon that any man who
could make himself such a masterpiece of a fool
as Jonathan had done that night, was better out of
the marriage state than in it. He told Hyssop as
she'd had a marvelous escape from a prize zany;
and his wife said the same. But the girl couldn't
see it like that. She knowed Jonathan weren't a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
prize zany, and his raging pride didn't anger her,
for she admired it something wonderful, and it
only made her feel her loss all the crueller to see
what a terrible rare, haughty sort of a chap he was.
There were a lot of other men would have had her,
and twice as many again, if they'd known about
the money; but they all seemed as tame as robins
beside her hawk of a Jonathan. She had plenty of
devil in her, too, when it came to the fighting
pitch; and now, while he merely said that the
match was broken off through a difference of opinion,
and gave no reason for it, she set to work with
all her might to get him back again, and used her
love-sharpened wits so well as she knew how, to
best him into matrimony.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In truth she made poor speed. Jonathan was
always civil afterwards; but you might as soon
have tried to thaw an iceberg with a box of matches
as to get him round again by gentleness and affection.
He was the sort that can't be won with kindness.
He felt he'd treated the world better than
the world had treated him, and the thought
shriveled his heart a bit. Always shy and suspicious,
you might say; and yet, underneath it, the
most honorable and upright and high-minded man
you could wish to meet. Hyssop loved him like
her life, and she got a bit poorly in health after
their sad quarrel. Then chance willed it that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
going down from Princetown to Plymouth by train&mdash;to
see a chemist, and get something to make her
eat&mdash;who should be in the selfsame carriage but
Mr. Drake and his hind, Thomas Parsons.</p>

<p>There was others there, too; and it fell out that
an old fellow as knowed Jonathan's grandfather
before him, brought up the yarn about Miser
Brimpson, and asked young Drake if he took any
stock in it.</p>

<p>Of course the man pooh-poohed such foolery,
and told the old chap not to talk nonsense like
that in the ear of the nineteenth century; but when
Jonathan and Parsons had got out of the train&mdash;which
they did do at Yelverton station&mdash;Hyssop,
as knowed the old man, axed him to tell more
about the miser; and he explained, so well as he
knew how, that Brimpson Drake had made untold
thousands out of the French and American prisoners,
and that, without doubt, 'twas all hidden even
to this day at Dunnabridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course Jonathan's too clever to believe such
a tale&mdash;like his father before him; but his grandfather
believed it, and the old blid spent half his
time poking about the farm. Only, unfortunately,
he didn't have no luck. But 'tis there for sure; and
if Jonathan had enough faith he'd come by it&mdash;not
by digging and wasting time and labor, but by
doing what is right and proper when you'm dealing
with such matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what might that be?&rdquo; axed Miss Burges.</p>

<p>Just then, however, the train for Plymouth ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
up, and the old man told her that he'd explain
some other time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This generation laughs at such things,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;but they laugh best who laugh last, and, for
all we can say to the contrary, 'tis nought but his
conceit and pride be standing between that stiff-necked
youth and the wealth of a bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hyssop, she thought a lot upon this; but she
hadn't no need to go to the old chap again, as she
meant to do, for when she got home, her uncle&mdash;Farmer
Stonewer&mdash;knowed all about the matter,
and told her how 'twas a very rooted opinion
among the last generation that a miser's spirit
never could leave its hidden hoard till the stuff was
brought to light, and in human hands once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Millions of good money has been found in that
manner, if all we hear is true,&rdquo; declared Farmer
Jimmy; &ldquo;and if one miser has been known to walk,
which nobody can deny, then why shouldn't
another? Them as believe in such dark things&mdash;and
I don't say I do, and I don't say I don't&mdash;them
as know of such mysteries happening in their
own recollection, or in the memory of their friends,
would doubtless say that Miser Brimpson still
creeps around his gold now and again; and if that
money be within the four corners of Dunnabridge
Farm, and if Jonathan happed to be on the lookout
on the rightful night and at the rightful
moment, 'tis almost any odds but he might see
his forbear sitting over his money-bags like a hen
on a clutch of eggs, and so recover the hoard.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But faith's needed for such a deed,&rdquo; Mrs.
Stonewer told her niece; &ldquo;and that pig-headed
creature haven't no faith. Too proud, he is, to
believe in anything he don't understand. 'Twas
even so with Lucifer afore him. If you told him&mdash;Jonathan&mdash;this
news, he'd rather let the money
go than set off ghost-hunting in cold blood. Yet
there it is: and a humbler-minded fashion of chap,
with the Lord on his side, and a trustful heart in
his bosom, might very like recover all them tubs
of cash the miser come by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then he'd have thousands to my poor
tens,&rdquo; said Hyssop. &ldquo;Not that he'd ever come
back to me now, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, all the same, she knowed by the look in
Jonathan's eye when they met, that he loved her
still, and that his silly, proud heart was hungering
after her yet, though he'd rather have been drawn
under a harrow than show a spark of what was
burning there.</p>

<p>And so, upon this nonsense about a buried
treasure she set to work again to use her brains,
and see if there might be any road out of the trouble
by way of Miser Brimpson's ghost.</p>

<p>What she did, none but them as helped her ever
knew, until the story comed round to me; but
'twas the cleverest thing that ever I heard of a
maiden doing, and it worked a wonder. In fact, I
can't see but a single objection to the plot, though
that was a serious thing for the girl. It lay in the
fact that there had to be a secret between Hyssop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and her husband; and she kept it close as the grave
until the grave itself closed over him. Yet 'twas
an innocent secret, too; and, when all's said, 'tisn't
a wedded pair in five hundred as haven't each
their one little cupboard fast locked, with the key
throwed away.</p>

<p>Six months passed by, and Jonathan worked as
only he knowed how to work, and tried to forget
his sad disappointment by dint of toil. Early and
late he labored, and got permission to reclaim a
bit of moor for a &ldquo;newtake,&rdquo; and so added a very
fair three acres to his farm. He noticed about this
time that his hind, Parsons, did oft drag up the
subject of Miser Brimpson Drake; and first Jonathan
laughed, and then he was angered, and bade
Thomas hold his peace. But, though a very obedient
and humble sort of man, Parsons would hark
back to the subject, and tell how his father had
known a man who was own brother to a miser; and
how, when the miser died, his own brother had seen
him clear as truth in the chimley-corner of his
room three nights after they'd buried him; and
how they made search, and found, not three feet
from where the ghost had stood, a place in the wall
with seventeen golden sovereigns hid in it, and a
white witch's cure for glanders. Thomas Parsons
swore on the Book to this; and he said, as a certain
fact, that New Year's Night was the time most
misers walked; and he advised Jonathan not to be
dead to his own interests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least, as a thinking man, that believes in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
religion and the powers of the air, in Bible word,
you might give it a chance,&rdquo; said Thomas; and
then Jonathan told him to shut his mouth, and
not shame Dunnabridge by talking such childish
nonsense.</p>

<p>The next autumn Jonathan went up beyond
Exeter to buy some of they black-faced, horned
Scotch sheep, and he wanted for Parsons to go
with him; but his man falled ill the night afore,
and so young Hacker went instead.</p>

<p>Drake reckoned then that Thomas Parsons
would have to leave, for Dunnabridge weren't a
place for sick folk; and he'd made up his mind after
he came back to turn the old chap off; but Thomas
was better when the master got home, so the question
of sacking him was let be, and Jonathan contented
himself by telling Tom that, if he falled ill
again, 'twould be the last time. And Parsons said
that was as it should be; but he hoped that at his
age&mdash;merely sixty-five or thereabout&mdash;he wouldn't
be troubled with his breathing parts again for half
a score o' years at least. He added that he'd done
his work as usual while the master was away; but
he didn't mention that Hyssop Burges had made
so bold as to call at Dunnabridge with a pony and
cart, and that she'd spent a tidy long time there,
and gone all over the house and farmyard, among
other places, afore she drove off again.</p>

<p>And the next chapter of the story was told by
Jonathan himself to his two men on the first day
of the following year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>There was but little light of morning just then,
and the three of 'em were putting down some
bread and bacon and a quart of tea by candlelight
in the Dunnabridge kitchen, when Thomas saw
that his master weren't eating nothing to name.
Instead, he went out to the barrel and drawed
himself a pint of ale, and got along by the peat
fire with it, and stuck his boots so nigh the scads
as he dared without burning 'em.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's amiss?&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Don't say
you'm sick, master. And if you be, I lay no liquor
smaller than brandy will fetch you round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ban't sick,&rdquo; answered Jonathan shortly.</p>

<p>He seemed in doubt whether to go on. Then he
resolved to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a man in the yard last night,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and, if I thought as either of you chaps
knowed anything about it, I'd turn you off this
instant, afore you'd got the bacon out of your
throats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man? Never!&rdquo; cried Parsons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was it the dog didn't bark?&rdquo; asked
Hacker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How the devil do I know why he didn't bark?&rdquo;
answered Jonathan, dark as night, and staring in
the fire. One side of his face was red with the
flames, and t'other side blue as steel along of the
daylight just beginning to filter in at the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I can say is this,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I turned in
at half-after ten, just after that brace of old fools
to Brownberry went off to see the New Year in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
I slept till midnight; then something woke me with
a start. What 'twas, I can't tell, but some loud
sound near at hand, no doubt. I was going off
again when I heard more row&mdash;a steady sound
repeated over and over. And first I thought 'twas
owls; and then I heard 'twas not. You might have
said 'twas somebody thumping on a barrel; but,
at any rate, I woke up, and sat up, and found the
noise was in the yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked out of my chamber window then, and
the moon was bright as day, and the stars sparkling
likewise; and there, down by 'the Judge's Table'
where the thorn-tree grows, I see a man standing
by the old barrel as plain as I see you chaps now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Judge's Table&rdquo; be a wonnerful curiosity
at Dunnabridge, and if you go there you'll do well
to ax to see it. 'Tis a gert slab of moorstone said
to have come from Crokern Torr, where the tinners
held theer parliament in the ancient times. Now
it bides over a water-trough with a white-thorn
tree rising up above.</p>

<p>Jonathan took his breath when he'd got that
far, and fetched his pipe out of his pocket and
lighted it. Then he drank off half the beer, and
spat in the fire, and went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man so tall as me, if not taller. He'd got one
of them old white beaver hats on his head, and he
wore a flowing white beard, so long as my plough-horse's
tail, and he walked up and down, up and
down over the stones, like a sailor walks up and
down on the deck of a ship. I shouted to the chap,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
but he didn't take no more notice than the moon.
Up and down he went; and then I told him, if he
wasn't off inside two minutes, I'd get my fowling-piece
and let fly. Still he paid no heed; and I don't
mind saying to you men that, for half a second, I
felt creepy-crawly and goose-flesh down the back.
But 'twas only the cold, I reckon, for my window
was wide open, and I'd been leaning out of it for a
good while into ten degrees of frost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that, I got angry, and went down house
and hitched the gun off the hooks over the mantelpiece,
and ran out, just as I was, in nought but my
boots and my nightshirt. The hour was so still
as the grave at first, and the moon shone on the
river far below and lit up the eaves and windows;
and then, through the silence, I heard Widecombe
bells ringing in the New Year. But the old night-bird
in his top hat was gone. Not a hair of his
beard did he leave behind. I looked about, and
then up came the dog, barking like fury, not knowing
who I was, dressed that way, till he heard my
voice. And that's the tale; and who be that curious
old rascal I'd much like to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They didn't answer at first, and the daylight
gained on 'em. Then old Parsons spoke up, and
wagged his head and swore that 'twas no man his
master had seen, but a creature from the other
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll lay my life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;'twas the spectrum
of Miser Brimpson as you saw walking; and I'll
take oath by the New Year that 'twas his way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
show where his stuff be buried. For God's sake,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;if you don't want to get into trouble
with unknown creatures, go out and pull up the
cobblestones, and see if there's anything underneath
'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jonathan made as though the whole thing
was nonsense, and wouldn't let neither Thomas
nor Hacker move a pebble. Only, the next day,
he went off to a very old chap called Samuel Windeatt,
whose father had been a boy at the time of
the War Prison, and was said to have seen and
known Miser Brimpson in the flesh. And the old
man declared that, in his childish days, he'd heard
of the miser, and that he certainly wore a beaver
hat and had a white beard a yard long. So Jonathan
came home again more thoughtful than afore,
and finally&mdash;though he declared that he was
ashamed to do it&mdash;he let Tom overpersuade him;
and two days after the three men set to work where
Drake had seen the spectrum.</p>

<p>They dug and they dug, this way and that; and
Jonathan found nought, and Parsons found
nought; but Hacker came upon a box, and they
dragged it out of the earth, and underneath of it
was another box like the first. They was a pair of
old rotten wood chests, by the look of them, made
of boards nailed together with rusty nails. No
locks or keys they had; but that was no matter,
for they fell abroad at a touch, and inside of them
was a lot of plate&mdash;candlesticks, snuffers, tea-kettles,
table silver, and the like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; cried out Jonathan. &ldquo;'Tis all
pewter trash, not worth a five-pound note! Us'll
dig again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And dig they did for a week, till the farmyard
in that place was turned over like a trenched
kitchen-garden. But not another teaspoon did
they find.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, somebody as understood
such things explained to young Drake that the
stuff unearthed was not pewter, nor yet Britannia
metal neither, but old Sheffield plate, and worth
plenty of good money at that.</p>

<p>Jonathan felt too mazed with the event to do
anything about it for a month; then he went to
Plymouth, and took a few pieces of the find in his
bag. And the man what he showed 'em to was so
terrible interested that nothing would do but he
must come up to Dunnabridge and see the lot. He
offered two hundred and fifty pound for the things
on the nail; so Jonathan saw very clear that they
must be worth a good bit more. They haggled for
a week, and finally the owner went up to Exeter
and got another chap to name a price. In the long
run, the dealers halved the things, and Jonathan
comed out with a clear three hundred and fifty-four
pound.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>He wasn't very pleased to talk about his luck,
and inquisitive people got but little out of him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
on the subject; but, of course, Parsons and Hacker
spoke free and often on the subject, for 'twas the
greatest adventure as had ever come to them in
their lives; and, from telling the tale over and over
old Parsons got to talk about it as if he'd seen the
ghost himself.</p>

<p>Then, after he'd chewed over the matter for a
space of three or four months, and spring was come
again, Jonathan Drake went off one night to White
Works, just the same as he used to do when he was
courting Hyssop Burges; and there was the little
party as usual, with Mrs. Stonewer knitting, and
Farmer reading yesterday's newspaper, and Hyssop
sewing in her place by her aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; says Farmer Jimmy, &ldquo;wonders never
cease! And to see you again here be almost so big
a wonder as that they tell about of the old miser's
tea-things. I'm sure we all give you joy, Jonathan;
and I needn't tell you as we was cruel pleased to
hear about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man thanked them very civilly, and
said how 'twas a coorious come-along-of-it, and
he didn't hardly know what to think of the matter
even to that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should reckon 'twas a bit of nonsense what
I'd dreamed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but money's money, as
who should know better than me? And, by the
same token, I want a few words with Hyssop if
she'm willing to give me ten minutes of her time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'm welcome, Mr. Drake,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He started at the surname; but she got up, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
they went off just in the usual way to the parlor;
and when they was there, she sat down in her old
corner of the horsehair sofa and looked at him.
But he didn't sit down&mdash;not at first. He walked
about fierce and talked fierce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll ax one question afore I go on, and, if the
answer's what I fear, I'll trouble you no more,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;In a word, be you tokened again? I
suppose you be, for you're not the sort to go begging.
Say it quick if 'tis so, and I'll be off and
trouble you no further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Drake. I'm free as the day you&mdash;you
throwed me over,&rdquo; she answered, in a very quiet
little voice.</p>

<p>He snorted at that, but was too mighty thankful
to quarrel with the words. She could see he began
to grow terrible excited now; and he walked up
and down, taking shorter and shorter strides this
way and that, like a hungry caged tiger as knows
his bit of horse-flesh be on the way.</p>

<p>At last he bursts out again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a lot of lies told about that old plate
us found at Dunnabridge. But the truth of the
matter is, that I sold it for three hundred and fifty-four
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Tom Parsons told uncle. A wonderful thing;
and we sat up all night talking about it, Mr. Drake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God's sake call me 'Jonathan'!&rdquo; he cried
out; &ldquo;and tell me&mdash;tell me what the figure of your
legacy was. You must tell me&mdash;you can't withhold
it. 'Tis life or death&mdash;to me.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>She'd never seen him so excited, but very well
knowed what was in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you must know, you must,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;I thought I told you when&mdash;when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you didn't. I wouldn't bide to hear.
Whatever 'twas, you'd got more than me, and that
was all I cared about; but now, if by good fortune
'tis less than mine, you understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course 'tis less. A hundred and eighty
pound and the interest&mdash;a little over two hundred
in all&mdash;is what I've gotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Then he axed her if she could marry him still,
or if she knew too much about his ways and his
ideas to care about doing so.</p>

<p>And she took him again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You see, Hyssop Burges was my mother, and
when father died I had the rights of the story from
her. By that time the old people at White Works
and Tom Parsons was all gone home, and the secret
remained safe enough with Hyssop herself.</p>

<p>The great difficulty was to put half her money
and more, slap into Jonathan's hands without his
knowing how it got there; and, even when the
game with the ghost was hit upon, 'twas hard to
know how to do it clever. Hyssop wanted to hide
golden sovereigns at Dunnabridge; but her uncle,
with wonnerful wit, pointed out that they'd all be
dated; and to get three hundred sovereigns and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
more a hundred years old could never have been
managed. Then old Thomas, who was in the
secret, of course, and played the part of Miser
Brimpson, and got five pounds for doing it so
clever, and another five after from his master,
when the stuff was found&mdash;he thought upon
trinkums and jewels; and finally Mrs. Stonewer,
as had a friend in the business, said that Sheffield
plate would do the trick. And she was right. The
plate was bought for three hundred and eighty
pound, and kept close at White Works till 'twas
known that Jonathan meant to go away and bide
away some days. Then my mother drove across
with it; and Thomas made the cases wi' old rotten
boards, and they drove a slant hole under the
cobbles, and got all vitty again long afore young
Drake came back home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me and Jonathan was wedded in the fall of
that year,&rdquo; said my mother to me when she told
the tale. &ldquo;And, come the next New Year's Night,
he was at our chamber window as the clock struck
twelve, and bided there looking out into the yard
for an hour, keen as the hawk that he was. He
thought I must be asleep; but well I knowed he
was seeking for an old man in a beaver hat wi' a
long white beard, and well I knowed he'd never
see him again. Of course your father took good
care not to tell me the next morning that he'd been
on the lookout for the ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And my mother, in her own last days, oft dwelt
on that trick; and sometimes she'd say, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
time for meeting father got nearer and nearer, &ldquo;I
wonder if 'twill make any difference in heaven,
where no secrets be hid?&rdquo; And, knowing father so
well as I had, I felt very sure as it might make a
mighty lot of difference. So, in my crafty way, I
hedged, and told mother that, for my part, I felt
sartain there were some secrets that wouldn't even
be allowed to come out at Judgment Day, for fear
of turning heaven into t'other place; and that this
was one of 'em. She always used to fret at that,
however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want for it to come out,&rdquo; she'd say. &ldquo;And,
if Jonathan don't know, I shall certainly tell him.
I've kept it in long enough, and I can't trust myself
to do it no more. He've got to know, and,
with all eternity to get over it and forgive me in,
I have a right to be hopeful that he will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hyssop Drake died in that fixed resolve; and
I'm sure I trust that, when 'tis my turn to join my
parents again, I shall find no shadow between 'em.
But there's a lot of doubt about it&mdash;knowing
father.</p>

<h2>The Haunted Photograph</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> RUTH McENERY STUART</h4>

<p>To the ordinary observer it was just a common
photograph of a cheap summer hotel. It hung
sumptuously framed in plush, over the Widow
Morris's mantel, the one resplendent note in an
otherwise modest home, in a characteristic Queen
Anne village.</p>

<p>One had only to see the rapt face of its owner
as she sat in her weeds before the picture, which
she tearfully pronounced &ldquo;a strikin' likeness,&rdquo; to
sympathize with the townsfolk who looked askance
at the bereaved woman, even while they bore
with her delusion, feeling sure that her sudden
sorrow had set her mind agog.</p>

<p>When she had received the picture through the
mail, some months before the fire which consumed
the hotel&mdash;a fire through which she had not passed,
but out of which she had come a widow&mdash;she
proudly passed it around among the friends waiting
with her at the post-office, replying to their questions
as they admired it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! That's where he works&mdash;if you can
call it work. He's the head steward in it. All that
row o' winders where you see the awnin's down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
they're his&mdash;an' them that ain't down, they're his,
too&mdash;that is to say, it's his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, he's got the whip hand over the cook
an' the sto'eroom, an' that key don't go out o' his
belt unless he knows who's gettin' what&mdash;an' he's
firm. Morris always was. He's like the iron law
of the Ephesians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What key?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was an old lady who held the picture at arm's
length, the more closely to scan it, who asked the
question. She asked it partly to know, as neither
man nor key appeared in the photograph, and
partly to parry the &ldquo;historic allusion&rdquo;&mdash;a disturbing
sort of fire for which Mrs. Morris was rather
noted and which made some of her most loyal
townsfolk a bit shy of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain't referrin' to the picture,&rdquo; she hastened
to explain. &ldquo;I mean the keys thet he always
carries in his belt. The reg'lar joke there is to call
him 'St. Peter,' an' he takes it in good part, for, he
declares, if there <i>is</i> such a thing <i>as</i> a similitude to
the kingdom o' Heaven <i>in</i> a hotel, why, it's in the
providential supply department which, in a manner,
hangs to his belt. He always humors a joke&mdash;'specially
on himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one will ever know through what painful
periods of unrequited longing the Widow Morris
had sought solace in this, her only cherished &ldquo;relic,&rdquo;
after the &ldquo;half hour of sky-works&rdquo; which had
made her, in her own vernacular, &ldquo;a lonely, conflagrated
widow, with a heart full of ashes,&rdquo; before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the glad moment when it was given her to discern
in it an unsuspected and novel value. First had
come, as a faint gleam of comfort, the reflection
that although her dear lost one was not in evidence
in the picture, he had really been inside the building
when the photograph was taken, and so, of
course, <i>he must be in there yet</i>!</p>

<p>At first she experienced a slight disappointment
that her man was not visible, at door or window.
But it was only a passing regret. It was really
better to feel him surely and broadly within&mdash;at
large in the great house, free to pass at will from
one room to another. To have had him fixed, no
matter how effectively, would have been a limitation.
As it was, she pressed the picture to her
bosom as she wondered if, perchance, he would not
some day come out of his hiding to meet her.</p>

<p>It was a muffled pleasure and tremulously entertained
at first, but the very whimsicality of it was
an appeal to her sensitized imagination, and so,
when finally the thing did really happen, it is small
wonder that it came somewhat as a shock.</p>

<p>It appears that one day, feeling particularly
lonely and forlorn, and having no other comfort,
she was pressing her tear-stained face against the
row of window-shutters in the room without awnings,
this being her nearest approach to the alleged
occupant's bosom, when she was suddenly startled
by a peculiar swishing sound, as of wind-blown rain,
whereupon she lifted her face to perceive that it
was indeed raining, and then, glancing back at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
photograph, she distinctly saw her husband rushing
from one window to another, drawing down the
sashes on the side of the house that would have
been exposed to the real shower whose music was
in her ears.</p>

<p>This was a great discovery, and, naturally
enough, it set her weeping, for, she sobbed, it made
her feel, for a minute, that she had lost her widowhood
and that, after the shower, he'd be coming
home.</p>

<p>It might well make any one cry to suddenly lose
the pivot upon which his emotions are swung. At
any rate, Mrs. Morris cried. She said that she
cried all night, first because it seemed so spooky to
see him whose remains she had so recently buried
on faith, waiving recognition in the d&eacute;bris, dashing
about now in so matter-of-fact a way.</p>

<p>And then she wept because, after all, he did not
come.</p>

<p>This was the formal beginning of her sense of
personal companionship in the picture&mdash;companionship,
yes, of delight in it, for there is even
delight in tears&mdash;in some situations in life. Especially
is this true of one whose emotions are her
only guides, as seems to have been the case with
the Widow Morris.</p>

<p>After seeing him draw the window-sashes&mdash;and
he had drawn them <i>down</i>, ignoring her presence&mdash;she
sat for hours, waiting for the rain to stop. It
seemed to have set in for a long spell, for when she
finally fell asleep, &ldquo;from sheer disappointment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
'long towards morning,&rdquo; it was still raining, but
when she awoke the sun shone and all the windows
in the picture were up again.</p>

<p>This was a misleading experience, however, for
she soon discovered that she could not count upon
any line of conduct by the man in the hotel, as the
fact that it had one time rained in the photograph
at the same time that it rained outside was but a
coincidence and she was soon surprised to perceive
all quiet along the hotel piazza, not even an awning
flapping, while the earth, on her plane, was torn
by storms.</p>

<p>On one memorable occasion when her husband
had appeared, flapping the window-panes from
within with a towel, she had thought for one brief
moment that he was beckoning to her, and that
she might have to go to him, and she was beginning
to experience terror, with shortness of breath and
other premonitions of sudden passing, when she
discovered that he was merely killing flies, and she
flurriedly fanned herself with the asbestos mat
which she had seized from the stove beside her,
and staggered out to a seat under the mulberries,
as she stammered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do declare, Morris'll be the death of me yet.
He's 'most as much care to me dead as he was
alive&mdash;I made sure&mdash;made sure he'd come after
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, feeling her own fidelity challenged, she
hastened to add:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that I hadn't rather go to him than to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
any trip in the world, but&mdash;but I never did fancy
that hotel, and since I've got used to seein' him
there so constant, I feel sure that's where we'd put
up. My belief is, anyway, that if there's hereafters
for some things, there's hereafters for all.
From what I can gather, I reckon I'm a kind of a
cross between a Swedenborgian and a Gates-ajar&mdash;that,
of course, engrafted on to a Methodist. Now,
that hotel, when it was consumed by fire, which
to it was the same as mortal death, why, it either
ascended into Heaven, in smoke, or it fell, in ashes&mdash;to
the other place. If it died worthy, like as not
it's undergoin' repairs now for a 'mansion,' jasper
cupalos, an'&mdash;but, of course, such as that could
be run up in a twinklin'.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, from what I've heard, it's more likely
gone <i>down</i> to its deserts. It would seem hard for a
hotel with so many awned-off corridors an' palmed
embrasures with teet-a-teet sofas, to live along
without sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood on her step-ladder, wiping the face of
the picture as she spoke, and as she began to back
down she discovered the cat under her elbow, glaring
at the picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Kitty! Spit away!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Like as not you see even more than I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as she slipped the ladder back into the
closet, she remarked&mdash;this to herself, strictly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it hadn't 'a' been for poor puss, I'd 'a' had
a heap more pleasure out o' this picture than
what I have had&mdash;or will be likely to have again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
The way she's taken on, I've almost come to hate
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A serpent had entered her poor little Eden&mdash;even
the green-eyed monster constrictor, who, if
given full swing, would not spare a bone of her
meager comfort.</p>

<p>A neighbor who chanced to come in at the time,
unobserved overheard the last remark, and Mrs.
Morris, seeing that she was there, continued in an
unchanged tone, while she gave her a chair:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mis' Withers, you can easy guess
who I refer to. I mean that combly-featured
wench that kep' the books an' answered the telephone
at the hotel&mdash;when she found the time from
her meddlin'. Somehow, I never thought about
her bein' <i>burned in</i> with Morris till puss give her
away. Puss never did like the girl when she was
alive, an' the first time I see her scratch an' spit at
the picture, just the way she used to do whenever
<i>she</i> come in sight, why, it just struck me like a clap
o' thunder out of a clear sky that puss knew who
she was a-spittin' at&mdash;an' I switched around sudden&mdash;an'
glanced up sudden&mdash;an'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what I seen, I seen! There was that
beautied-up typewriter settin' in the window-sill
o' Morris's butler's pantry&mdash;an' if she didn't wink
at me malicious, then I don't know malice when I
see it. An' she used her fingers against her nose,
too, most defiant and impolite. So I says to puss
I says, 'Puss,' I says, 'there's <i>goin's on</i> in that hotel,
sure as fate. Annabel Bender has got the better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
o' me, for once!' An', tell the truth, it did spoil the
photograph for me for a while, for, of course, after
that, if I didn't see him somewheres on the watch
for his faithful spouse, I'd say to myself, 'He's inside
there with that pink-featured hussy!'</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, a man's a man, Mis' Withers&mdash;'specially
Morris, an' with his lawful wife cut off
an' indefinitely divorced by a longevitied family&mdash;an'
another burned in with him&mdash;well, his faithfulness
is put to a trial by fire, as you might say. So,
as I say, it spoiled the picture for me, for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An', to make matters worse, it wasn't any time
before I recollected that Campbellite preacher thet
was burned in with them, an' with that my imagination
run riot, an' I'd think to myself, '<i>If</i> they're
inclined, they cert'n'y have things handy!' Then
I'd ketch myself an' say, 'Where's your faith in
Scripture, Mary Marthy Matthews, named after
two Bible women an' born daughter to an apostle?
What's the use?' I'd say, an' so, first an' last, I'd
get a sort o' alpha an' omega comfort out o' the
passage about no givin' in marriage. Still, there'd
be times, pray as I would, when them three would
loom up, him an' her&mdash;<i>an'</i> the Campbellite
preacher. I know his license to marry would run
out <i>in time</i>, but for eternity, of course we don't
know. Seem like everything would last forever&mdash;an'
then again, if I've got a widow's freedom,
Morris must be classed as a widower, if he's anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I'd get some relief in thinkin' about his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
disposition. Good as he was, Morris was fickle-tasted,
not in the long run, but day in an' day out,
an' even if he'd be taken up with her he'd get a
distaste the minute he reelized she'd be there interminable.
That's Morris. Why, didn't he used
to get nervous just seein' <i>me</i> around, an' me his
own selected? An' didn't I use to make some
excuse to send him over to Mame Maddern's ma's
ma's&mdash;so's he'd be harmlessly diverted? She was
full o' talk, and she was ninety-odd an' asthmatic,
but he'd come home from them visits an' call me
his child wife. I've had my happy moments!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know a man'll get tired of himself, even,
if he's condemned to it too continual, and think of
that blondinetted typewriter for a steady diet&mdash;to
a man like Morris! Imagine her when her hair
dye started to give out&mdash;green streaks in that
pompadour! So, knowin' my man, I'd take courage
an' I'd think, 'Seein' me cut off, he'll soon be
wantin' me more than ever'&mdash;an' so he does. It's
got so now that, glance up at that hotel any time
I will, I can generally find him on the lookout, an'
many's the time I've stole in an' put on a favoryte
apron o' his with blue bows on it, when we'd be
alone an' nobody to remark about me breakin' my
mournin'. Dear me, how full o' b'oyancy he was&mdash;a
regular boy at thirty-five, when he passed away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it any wonder that her friends exchanged
glances while Mrs. Morris entertained them in so
droll a way? Still, as time passed and she not only
brightened in the light of her delusion, but proceeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
to meet the conditions of her own life by
opening a small shop in her home, and when she
exhibited a wholesome sense of profit and loss, her
neighbors were quite ready to accept her on terms
of mental responsibility.</p>

<p>With occupation and a modest success, emotional
disturbance was surely giving place to an
even calm, when, one day, something happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris sat behind her counter, sorting
notions, puss asleep beside her, when she heard the
swish of thin silk, with a breath of familiar perfume,
and, looking up, whom did she see but the
blond lady of her troubled dreams striding bodily
up to the counter, smiling as she swished.</p>

<p>At the sight the good woman first rose to her
feet, and then as suddenly dropped&mdash;flopped&mdash;breathless
and white&mdash;backward&mdash;and had to be
revived, so that for the space of some minutes
things happened very fast&mdash;that is, if we may
believe the flurried testimony of the blonde, who,
in going over it, two hours later, had more than
once to stop for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, say!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;Did you ever!
<i>Such</i> a turn as took her! I hadn't no more 'n
stepped in the door when she succumbed, green as
the Ganges, into her own egg-basket&mdash;an' it full!
An' she was on the eve o' floppin' back into the
prunin' scizzor points up, when I scrambled over
the counter, breakin' my straight-front in two,
which she's welcome to, poor thing! Then I loaned
her my smellin'-salts, which she held her breath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
against until it got to be a case of smell or die, an'
she smelt! Then it was a case of temporary spasms
for a minute, the salts spillin' out over her face, but
when the accident evaporated, an' she opened her
eyes, rational, I thought to myself, 'Maybe she
don't know she's keeled an' would be humiliated if
she did,' so I acted callous, an' I says, offhand like,
I says, pushin' her apron around behind her over
its <i>vice versa</i>, so's to cover up the eggs, which I
thought had better be broke to her gently, I says.
'I just called in, Mis' Morris, to borry your recipe
for angel-cake&mdash;or maybe get you to bake one for
us' (I knew she baked on orders). An' with that,
what does she do but go over again, limp as wet
starch, down an' through every egg in that basket,
solid <i>an'</i> fluid!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, by this time, a man who had seen her at
her first worst an' run for a doctor, he come in with
three, an' whilst they were bowin' to each other an'
backin', I giv' 'er stimulus an' d'rectly she turned
upon me one rememberable gaze, an' she says,
'Doctors,' says she, 'would you think they'd have
the gall to try to get me to cook for 'em? They've
ordered angel-ca&mdash;&mdash;' An' with that, over she
toppled again, no pulse nor nothin', same as the
dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the blonde talked she busied herself with
her loosely falling locks, which she tried vainly to
entrap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' yet you say she ain't classed as crazy? I'd
say it of her, sure! An' so old Morris is dead&mdash;burned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in that old hotel! Well, well! Poor old
fellow! Dear old place! What times I've had!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke through a mouthful of gilt hairpins
and her voice was as an &AElig;olian harp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' he burned in it&mdash;an' she's a widow yet!
Yes, I did hear there'd been a fire, but you never
can tell. I thought the chimney might 'a' burned
out&mdash;an' I was in the thick of bein' engaged to the
night clerk at the Singin' Needles Hotel at Pineville
at the time&mdash;an' there's no regular mail there.
I thought the story might be exaggerated. Oh no,
I didn't marry the night clerk. I'm a bride now,
married to the head steward, same rank as poor
old Morris&mdash;an' we're just <i>as</i> happy! I used to
pleg Morris about <i>her</i> hair, but I'd have to let up
on that now. Mine's as red again as hers. No, not
my hair&mdash;<i>mine's</i> hair. It's as red as a flannen
drawer, every bit an' grain!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, say,&rdquo; she added, presently, &ldquo;when she
gets better, just tell her never mind about that
reci-pe. I copied it out of her reci-pe book whilst
she was under the weather, an' dropped a dime in
her cash-drawer. I recollect how old Morris used
to look forward to her angel-cakes week-ends he'd
be goin' home, an' you know there's nothin' like
havin' ammunition, in marriage, even if you never
need it. Mine's in that frame of mind now that
transforms my gingerbread into angel-cake, but the
time may come when I'll have to beat my eggs to a
fluff even for angel-cake, so's not to have it taste
like gingerbread to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, he's not with me this trip. I just run
down for a lark to show my folks my ring an'
things, an' let 'em see it's really so. He give me
considerable jewelry. His First's taste run that
way, an' they ain't no children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this amethyst is the weddin'-ring. I
selected that on account of him bein' a widower.
It's the nearest I'd come to wearin' second mournin'
for a woman I can't exactly grieve after. The year
not bein' up is why he stayed home this trip. He
didn't like to be seen traversin' the same old haunts
with Another till it <i>was</i> up. I wouldn't wait
because, tell the truth, I was afraid. He ain't like
a married man with me about money yet, an' it's
liable to seize him any day. He might say that he
couldn't afford the trip, or that we couldn't, which
would amount to the same thing. I rather liked
him bein' a little ticklish about goin' around with
me for a while. It's one thing to do a thing an'
another to be brazen about it&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if she don't get better&rdquo;&mdash;the reversion was
to the Widow Morris&mdash;&ldquo;if she don't get her mind
poor thing! there's a fine insane asylum just out of
Pineville, an' I'd like the best in the world to look
out for her. It would make an excuse for me to
go in. They say they have high old times there.
Some days they let the inmates do 'most any old
thing that's harmless. They even give 'em unpoisonous
paints an' let 'em paint each other up.
One man insisted he was a barber-pole an' ringed
himself accordingly, an' then another chased him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
around for a stick of peppermint candy. Think of
all that inside a close fence, an' a town so dull an'
news-hungry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they say Thursdays is paint days, an', of
course, Fridays, they are scrub days. They pass
around turpentine an' hide the matches. But, of
course, Mis' Morris may get the better of it. 'Tain'
every woman that can stand widowin', an' sometimes
them that has got the least out of marriage
will seem the most deprived to lose it&mdash;so they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blonde was a person of words.</p>

<br />

<p>When Mrs. Morris had fully revived and, after
a restoring &ldquo;night's sleep&rdquo; had got her bearings,
and when she realized clearly that her supposed
rival had actually shown up in the flesh, she visibly
braced up. Her neighbors understood that it must
have been a shock &ldquo;to be suddenly confronted with
any souvenir of the hotel fire&rdquo;&mdash;so one had expressed
it&mdash;and the incident soon passed out of the
village mind.</p>

<p>It was not long after this incident that the widow
confided to a friend that she was coming to depend
upon Morris for advice in her business.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Standing as he does, in that hotel door&mdash;between
two worlds, as you might say&mdash;why, he sees
both ways, and oftentimes he'll detect an event <i>on
the way to happening</i>, an' if it don't move too fast,
why, I can hustle an' get the better of things.&rdquo; It
was as if she had a private wire for advance information&mdash;and
she declared herself happy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, a certain ineffable light such as we sometimes
see in the eyes of those newly in love came
to shine from the face of the widow, who did not
hesitate to affirm, looking into space as she said it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Takin' all things into consideration, I can truly
say that I have never been so truly and ideely
married as since my widowhood.&rdquo; And she smiled
as she added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marriage, the earthly way, is vicissitudinous,
for everybody knows that anything is liable to
happen to a man at large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There had been a time when she lamented that
her picture was not &ldquo;life-sized&rdquo; as it would seem
so much more natural, but she immediately reflected
that that hotel would never have gotten
into her little house, and that, after all, the main
thing was having &ldquo;him&rdquo; under her own roof.</p>

<p>As the months passed Mrs. Morris, albeit she
seemed serene and of peaceful mind, grew very
white and still. Fire is white in its ultimate intensity.
The top, spinning its fastest, is said to
&ldquo;sleep&rdquo;&mdash;and the dancing dervish is &ldquo;still.&rdquo; So,
misleading signs sometimes mark the danger-line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under-eating and over-thinking&rdquo; was what the
doctor said while he felt her translucent wrist and
prescribed nails in her drinking-water. If he
secretly knew that kind nature was gently letting
down the bars so that a waiting spirit might easily
pass&mdash;well, he was a doctor, not a minister. His
business was with the body, and he ordered repairs.</p>

<p>She was only thirty-seven and &ldquo;well&rdquo; when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
passed painlessly out of life. It seemed to be
simply a case of going.</p>

<p>There were several friends at her bedside the
night she went, and to them she turned, feeling the
time come:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to give out that the first thing I
intend to do when I'm relieved is to call by there
for Morris&rdquo;&mdash;she lifted her weary eyes to the
picture as she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;for Morris&mdash;and I want it
understood that it'll be a vacant house from the
minute I depart. So, if there's any other woman
that's calculatin' to have any carryin's-on from
them windows&mdash;why, she'll be disappointed&mdash;she
or they. The one obnoxious person I thought was
in it <i>wasn't</i>. My imagination was tempted of
Satan an' I was misled. So it must be sold for just
what it is&mdash;just a photographer's photograph. If
it's a picture with a past, why, everybody knows
what that past is, and will respect it. I have tried
to conquer myself enough to bequeath it to the
young lady I suspicioned, but human nature is
frail, an' I can't quite do it, although doubtless she
would like it as a souvenir. Maybe she'd find it a
little too souvenirish to suit my wifely taste, and
yet&mdash;if a person is going to die&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I might legate it to her, partly to recompense
her for her discretion in leaving that hotel
when she did&mdash;an' partly for undue suspicion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a few debts to be paid, but there's eggs
an' things that'll pay them, an' there's no need to
have the hen settin' in the window showcase any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
longer. It was a good advertisement, but I've
often thought it might be embarrassin' to her.&rdquo;
She was growing weaker, but she roused herself to
amend:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better raffle the picture for a dollar a chance
an' let the proceeds go to my funeral&mdash;an' I want
to be buried in the hotel-fire general grave, commingled
with him&mdash;an' what's left over after the
debts are paid, I bequeath to <i>her</i>&mdash;to make amends&mdash;an'
if she don't care to come for it, let every
widow in town draw for it. But she'll come.
'Most any woman'll take any trip, if it's paid for&mdash;But
look!&rdquo; she raised her eyes excitedly toward
the mantel, &ldquo;Look! What's that he's wavin'? It
looks&mdash;oh yes, it is&mdash;it's our wings&mdash;two pairs&mdash;mine
a little smaller. I s'pose it'll be the same old
story&mdash;I'll never be able to keep up&mdash;to keep up
with him&mdash;an' I've been so hap&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Morris&mdash;I'm comin'&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she was gone&mdash;into a peaceful sleep from
which she easily passed just before dawn.</p>

<p>When all was well over, the sitting women rose
with one accord and went to the mantel, where one
even lighted an extra candle more clearly to scan
the mysterious picture.</p>

<p>Finally one said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may think I'm queer, but it does look
different to me already!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; said another, taking the candle.
&ldquo;Like a house for rent. I declare, it gives me the
cold shivers.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll pay my dollar gladly, and take a chance for
it,&rdquo; whispered a third, &ldquo;but I wouldn't let such a
thing as that enter my happy home&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither would I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor me, neither. I've had trouble enough.
My husband's first wife's portrait has brought me
discord enough&mdash;an' it was a straight likeness. I
don't want any more pictures to put in the hen-house
loft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the feeling ran among the wives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she who was blowing out the
candle, &ldquo;I'll draw for it&mdash;an' take it if I win it, an'
consider it a sort of inheritance. I never inherited
anything but indigestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last speaker was a maiden lady, and so was
she who answered, chuckling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's what I say! Anything for a change.
There'd be some excitement in a picture where a
man was liable to show up. It's more than I've
got now. I do declare it's just scandalous the way
we're gigglin', an' the poor soul hardly out o'
hearin'. She had a kind heart, Mis' Morris had,
an' she made herself happy with a mighty slim
chance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did&mdash;and I only wish there'd been a
better man waitin' for her in that hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<br /><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By WILL ADAMS</span></h4>


<p>One autumn evening, when the days were shortening
and the darkness fell early on Hotchkiss and
the frost was beginning to adorn with its fine glistening
lace the carbine barrels of the night sentries
as they walked post, Sergeants Hansen and Whitney
and Corporal Whitehall had come to Stone's
room after supper, feeling the need common to all
men in the first cold nights of the year for a cozy
room, a good smoke, and congenial companionship.</p>

<p>The steam heat, newly turned on, wheezed and
whined through the radiator: the air was blue and
dense with tobacco smoke; the three sergeants
reposed in restful, if inelegant attitudes, and Whitehall,
his feet on the window sill and his wooden
chair tilted back, was holding forth between puffs
at a very battered pipe about an old colored woman
who kept a little saloon in town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she got mad at those K troop men,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;An' nex' day when Turner stopped there for a
drink she says: 'You git outer yere! You men fum
de Arsenic wid de crossbones on you caps, I ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
lettin' you in; but de Medical Corpses an' de Non-efficient
Officers, dey may come.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laugh that followed was interrupted by the
approach of a raucous, shrieking noise that rose
and fell in lugubrious cadence. &ldquo;What the deuce!&rdquo;
exclaimed Whitehall, starting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's Bill,&rdquo; explained Stone. &ldquo;Bill Sullivan.
He thinks he's singin'. Funny you never heard
him before, Kid, but then he's not often taken that
way, thank the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Bill,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;an' tell us what's
the matter. Feel sick? Where's the pain?&rdquo; he
asked as big Bill appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, hombre, an' rest yo'self,&rdquo; invited
Whitney, and hospitably handed over his tobacco-pouch.
&ldquo;What was that tune yo'all were singin'
out yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; responded Bill, settling down.
&ldquo;That there tune was 'I Wonder Where You Are
To-night, My Love.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounded like 'Sister's Teeth Are Plugged with
Zinc,'&rdquo; commented Whitney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or 'Lookin' Through the Knot Hole in Papa's
Wooden Leg,'&rdquo; said Whitehall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or 'He Won't Buy the Ashman a Manicure
Set,'&rdquo; added Stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; reiterated Bill solemnly. &ldquo;It was like I
told yer; 'I Wonder Where You Are To-night,
My Love,' and it's a corker, too! I seen a feller
an' a goil sing it in Kelly's Voddyville Palace out
ter Cheyenne onct. Foist he'd sing one voise an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
then she'd sing the nex'. He was dressed like a
soldier, an' while he sang they was showin' tabloids
o' what the goil was a-doin' behind him; an' then
when she sang her voise he'd be in the tabloid, an'
when it got ter the last voise, an' he was dyin' on a
stretcher in a ambulance, everybody in the house
was a-cryin' so yer could hardly hear her. It was
great! My!&rdquo; continued Bill, spreading out his
great paws over the radiator, &ldquo;ain't this the
snappy evenin'? Real cold. Somehow it 'minds
me of the cold we had in China that time of the
Boxers, after we'd got ter the Legations; the nights
was cold just like this is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bill,&rdquo; said Whitney, &ldquo;I never knew
yo'all were there then. Why did yo' never tell us
befo'? What were yo' with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fourteenth Infantry,&rdquo; responded Bill proudly.
&ldquo;It's a great ol' regiment&mdash;don't care if they <i>are</i>
doughboys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What company was you in?&rdquo; inquired Hansen,
ponderously taking his pipe from his mouth and
breaking silence for the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;J Company, same as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this reply Stone opened his mouth abruptly
to say something, but thought better of it and shut
up again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was blame cold them nights a week or so
after we was camped in the Temple of Agriculture
(that's what they called it&mdash;I dunno why), but
say! the heat comin' up from Tientsin was fryin'!
It was jus' boilin', bakin', an' bubblin'&mdash;worse a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
heap than anythin' we'd had in the islands. We
chucked away mos' every last thing on that hike
but canteens an' rifles. It was a darn fool thing ter
do&mdash;the chuckin' was, o' course&mdash;but it come out
all right, 'cause extree supplies follered us up on the
Pie-ho in junks. Ain't that a funny name fer a
river? Pie-ho? Every time I got homesick I'd
say that river, an' then I'd see Hogan's Dairy
Lunch fer Ladies an' Gents on the ol' Bowery an'
hear the kid Mick Hogan yellin': 'Draw one in the
dark! White wings&mdash;let her flop! Pie-ho!' an' it
helped me a heap.&rdquo; Bill settled himself and
stretched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what I really wanted to tell youse about,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;was somepin' that happened one o' these
here cold nights. It gits almighty cold there in
September, an' it was sure the spookiest show I
ever seen. Even Marm Haggerty's table rappin's
in Hester Street never come up to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was three of us fellers who ran in a bunch
them days: me an' Buck Dugan, my bunkie, from
the Bowery like me (he was a corporal), an' Ranch
Fields&mdash;we called him that 'cause he always
woiked on a ranch before he come into the Fourteenth.
They was great fellers, Buck an' Ranch
was. Buck, now&mdash;yer couldn't phase him, yer
couldn't never phase him, no matter what sort o'
job yer put him up against he'd slide through slick
as a greased rat. The Cap'n, he knew it, too.
Onct when we was fightin' an' hadn't no men to
spare, he lef' Buck on guard over about twenty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Boxer prisoners in a courtyard an' tells him he
dassent let one escape. But Buck wants ter git
into the fight with the rest of the boys, an' when he
finds that if he leaves them Chinos loose in the
yard alone they'll git out plenty quick, what does
he do but tie 'em tight up by their pigtails to some
posts. He knows they can't undo them tight knots
backwards, an' no Chink would cut his pigtail if
he <i>did</i> have a knife&mdash;he'd die foist&mdash;an' so Buck
skidoos off to the fight, an', sure enough, when the
Cap'n wants them Boxers, they're ready, tied up
an' waitin'. That was his sort, an', gee, but he
was smart!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We was all right int'rested in them Allies, o'
course, an' watched 'em clost; but, 'Bill,' says
Buck ter me one night, 'its been woikin in me
nut that these here fellers ain't so different from
what we know a'ready. Excep' fer their uniform
an' outfits, we've met 'em all before but the Japs.
Why, look a-here,' says he, 'foist, there's the white
men&mdash;the English&mdash;ain't they jus' like us excep'
that they're thicker an' we're longer? An' their
Injun niggers&mdash;ain't we seen their clothes in the
comic op'ras an' them without their clothes in the
monkey cage at Central Park? An' their Hong-kong
China Regiment an' all the other Chinos is
jus' the same as yer meet in the pipe joints in Mott
Street. Then,' says he, 'come all the Dagos.
These leather necks of Macaroni Dagos we've
seen a swarmin' all over Mulberry Bend an' Five
Points; the Sauerkraut Dagos looks fer all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
woild like they was goin' ter a Sch&uuml;tzenfest up by
High Bridge; the Froggie Dagos you'll find packed in
them Frenchy restaraws in the Thirties&mdash;where yer
git blue wine&mdash;and them Vodki Dagos only needs
a pushcart ter make yer think yer in Baxter Street.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buck, he could sure talk, but Ranch, he wasn't
much on chin-chin. Little an' dark an' quiet he
was, an' jus' crazy fer dogs. Any old mutt'd do
fer him&mdash;jus' so's it was in the shape of a pup. He
was fair wild fer 'em. He picked up a yeller
cur out there the day after the Yangtsin fight, an'
that there no-account, mangy, flea-bitten mutt
had ter stay with us the whole time. If the pup
didn't stand in me an' Buck an' Ranch, he swore
he'd quit too, so we had to let him come, an' he
messed an' bunked with our outfit right along.
Ranch named him Daggett, after the Colonel,
which was right hard on the C. O., but I bet Ranch
thought he was complimentin' him. Why, Ranch
considered himself honored if any of the pup's fleas
hopped off on him. The pup he kep' along with
us right through everything; Ranch watchin' him
like the apple of his eye, an' he hardly ever was out
of our sight, till one night about a week after we
quartered in the temple he didn't turn up fer supper.
He was always so reg'lar at his chow that
Ranch he begin ter git the squirms an' when come
taps an' Daggett hadn't reported, Ranch had the
razzle-dazzles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nex' mornin' the foist thing he must go hunt
that pup, an' went a scoutin' all day, me an' Buck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
helpin' him&mdash;but nary pup; an' come another
supper without that miser'ble mutt, an' Ranch
was up an alley all right, all right. He was all
wore out, an' I made him hit the bunk early an'
try ter sleep; but, Lord! No sooner he'd drop off
'n he git ter twitchin' an' hitchin' an' wake up
a-yelpin' fer Daggett. Long about taps, Buck,
who's been out on a private reconnoissance, comes
back an' whispers ter me: 'Ssst, Bill! The cur's
found! Don't tell Ranch; the bloke'd die of heart
failure. I struck his trail an' follered it&mdash;an' say,
Bill, what'n thunder do yer think? Them heathen
Chinos has <i>et him</i>!' Lord, now, wouldn't that jolt
youse? Them Chinos a-eatin' Daggett! It give
me an awful jar, an' Buck he felt it, too. That
there mutt had acted right decent, an' we knew
Ranch would have bats in the belfry fer fair if he
hoid tell o' the pup's finish; so says Buck; 'Let's
not tell him, 'cause he's takin' on now like he'd
lost mother an' father an' best goil an' all, an' if he
knew Daggett was providin' chow fer Chinos he'd
go clean bug house an' we'd have ter ship him home
ter St. Elizabeth.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;I says O. K. ter that, an' we made it up not
ter let on ter Ranch; an' now here comes the spook
part yer been a-waitin' fer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four or five nights later I was on guard, an' my
post was the farthest out we had on the north.
There was an ol' road out over that way, an' I'd
hoid tell it led ter a ol' graveyard, but I hadn't
never been there myself an' hadn't thought much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
about it till 'long between two an' three o'clock,
as I was a-hikin' up an down, when somepin' comes
a-zizzin' down the road hell-fer-leather on to me,
a-yellin' somepin' fierce. Gee, but I was skeered!
I made sure it was a spook, an' there wasn't a bit o'
breath left in me. I was all to the bad that time
fer sure. Before I had time ter think even, that
screamin', streakin' thing was on me an a-grabbin'
roun' my knees; an' then I see it was one o' them
near-Christian Chinos, an' he's skeered more'n
me even. His eyes had popped clean out'n their
slits, an' his tongue was hangin' out by the roots,
he was that locoed. I raised the long yell fer
corporal of the guard, which happened, by good
luck, ter be Buck, an' when he come a-runnin',
thinkin' from the whoops I give we was bein'
rushed by the hole push of Boxers, the two of us
began proddin' at the Chink ter find out what was
doin'. Took us some time, too, with him bein' in
such a flutter an' hardly able ter even hand out his
darn ol' pigeon English, that sounds like language
comin' out of a sausage machine. When we did
savvy his line of chop-suey talk, we found out he'd
seen a ghost in the graveyard, an' not only seen it
but he knew who the spook was an' all about him.
We was gittin' some serious ourselves an' made
him tell us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems it was a mandarin&mdash;that's a sort o'
Chink police-court judge (till I got ter Tientsin I
always thought they was little oranges), an' this
tangerine's&mdash;I mean mandarin's&mdash;name was Wu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Ti Ming, an' he'd been a high mucky-muckraker
in his day, which was two or three hundred years
back. But the Emprer caught him deep in some
sort o' graft an' <i>took away his button</i> an' all o' his
dough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Lord!' says Buck when we come ter this,
'don't that prove what heathens Chinks is? Only
one button ter keep on their clothes with, an' the
Emprer he kin take it away! What did this here
Judge Ming do then, John? Use string or pins?'
This here John didn't seem ter savvy, but he said
that the mandarin took on so fer his button an'
his loss of pull in the ward that it was sure sad ter
see, an' by an' by the Emprer got busy again with
him an' had him finished up fer keeps; had him
die the 'death of a thousand cuts,' says John. It
sounded fierce ter me, but Buck he says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Pshaw! Anybody who's been shaved reg'lar
by them lady barbers on Fourth Avenyer would
'a' give the Emprer the merry ha-ha&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>&ldquo;After Ming was cut up they took the remains
of his corpse an' planted him in this here graveyard
up the road; but he wouldn't stay planted
an' began doin' stunts at night, 'topside walkee-walkee'
an' a-huntin' fer his lost button. He'd
used ter have the whole country scared up, but fer
the last twenty years he'd kep' right quiet an' had
hardly ever come out; but now sence the foreign
devils come (ain't that a sweet name fer us?) he's
up an' at it again worse than ever, an' the heathens
is on their ear. Fer four nights now they'd seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
him, wrapped in a blue robe, waitin' an' a-huntin'
behind tombstones an' walkin' round an' round
the graveyard lie a six days' race fer the belt at
Madison Square. John had jus' seen him on the
wall, an' that was why he come chargin' down the
road like forty cats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Will Mr. Ming's sperrit walk till he gits that
button back?' Buck asts. John says: 'Sure.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Well,' says Buck, 'why don't yer give him
one?'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'No can give. Only Emplor, only Son of
Heaven give.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Well, look here,' says Buck, 'we sand rabbits
ain't no sons of Heaven, but I'll be darned if we
couldn't spare a button ter lay the ghost of a pore
busted police-court judge, who's lost his job an'
his tin, if <i>that's</i> all he wants back. What time
does he come out at, John? Could we see him
ter-morrer night?' 'Sure could we,' says John;
'he'll show us the way, but he won't wait with us;
he's bad enough fer his.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Buck takes John an' goes back ter the guard
shack, as it's most time fer relief, an' after I got
back we told John ter git the hook, an' we talked
things over, an' Buck he was just wild ter see if he
couldn't lay that Chino ghost. His talents was
achin' ter git action on him; anythin' like that got
up his spunk. Says I:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Maybe Ranch kin help. We'll tell him ter-morrer
after guard mount. It'll take his mind off
Daggett.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;'No, yer don't,' says Buck. 'Don't yer dare
tell him. He's nervous as a cat over the pup as it
is, an' this spook business is awful skeery; I'm
feelin' woozy over it meself. I'm all off when it
comes ter ghosts&mdash;that is, if it's a real ghost. And
things here in Pekin' is so funny the odds is all in
favor of its bein' the sure thing. I ain't afeard o'
no kinds o' people, but I sure git cold feet when
I'm up against a ghost. Wouldn't that jar youse?
An' me a soldier; when it's a soldier's whole business
not ter <i>git</i> cold feet. But I'm bound I'll have
a show at that ol' spook even if it <i>does</i> skeer me out
o' my growth. Only don't yer dare tell Ranch.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nex' night, right after eleven o'clock rounds,
me an' Buck slipped outer our blankets, sneaked
out past the guard, an' met John, who was waitin'
fer us in the road jus' beyond where the last sentry
woulder seen him. It was cold as git out. Jus'
the same kind o' early cold as to-night, an' John's
teeth was chatterin' like peas in a box&mdash;he was
some loco with skeer, too, you bet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Which way?' says Buck, an' John spouts a
lot o' dope-joint lingo an' takes us up a side alley,
where there's a whole bunch o' Chinos waitin' fer
us, an' they begun a kowtowin' an' goin' on like
we was the whole cheese. Turned out that John
had jollied 'em that the Melican soldier mans was
big medicine an' would make Judge Ming quit the
midnight hike an' cut out scarin' 'em blue. That
jus' suited Buck; he was all there when it come ter
play commander in chief. He swelled up an' give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
'em a bundle o' talk that John put in Chino fer
'em, an' then finished up by showin' 'em a button&mdash;a
ol' United States Army brass button he'd cut
off his blue blouse&mdash;an' tol' 'em he was goin' ter
bury it in Ming's grave so as ter keep him bedded
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An' them simple idiots was pleased ter death,
an' the whole outfit escorted us over ter the graveyard,
but they shied at the gate (Lord, I hated ter
see 'em go&mdash;even if they <i>was</i> heathens!), an' let
John take us in an' show us where ter wait. He
put us in behind a pile o' little rocks in about the
middle o' the place near where Judge Ming hung
out, an' then retired on the main body at the
double, leavin' us two in outpost alone there together.
I hadn't never been ter a Chino buryin'
ground before, an' night time wasn't extree pleasant
fer a foist introduce. There was a new moon
that night&mdash;a little shavin' of a thing that hardly
gave no light, an' from where we was there was
a twisty pine tree branch that struck out right
acrost it like a picture card&mdash;two fer five. The
graveyard was all dark an' quiet, with little piles
o' rocks an' stone tables ter mark the graves, an' a
four- or five-foot wall runnin' all round it; an'
somehow, without nothin' stirrin' at all, the whole
blame place seemed chock full o' movin' shadders.
There wasn't a sound neither; not the least little
thing; jus' them shadders; an' the harder yous'd
look at 'em the more they seemed ter move. It
was cold, too, like I told yer&mdash;bitin' cold&mdash;an' me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
an' Buck squatted there tight together an' mos'
friz. We waited, an' we waited, an' <i>we waited</i>, an'
we got skeerder, an' skeerder, an' <i>skeerder</i>, an',
gee! how we shivered! Every minute we thought
we'd see Judge Ming, but a long time went by an'
he didn't come an' he <i>didn't</i> come. There we set,
strung up tight an' ready ter snap like a banjo
string, but nothin' ter see but the shakin' shadders
an' nothin' ter hear&mdash;nothin' but jus' dead, dead
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of a suddent Buck (he kin hear a pin drop
a mile away) nearly nips a piece out'n my arm as
he grips me. 'Listen!' says he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I listened an' listened, but I didn't hear
nothin', an' I told him so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Yes, yer do, yer bloke yer,' he whispers,
'Listen. Strain your years.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then way off I did begin ter hear somepin'.
It was a long, funny, waily cry, sort o' like the way
cats holler at each other at night. 'Oh-oo-oo,
oh-oo-oo!' like that, an' it come nearer an' nearer.
Then all of a suddent somepin' popped up on the
graveyard wall about a hundred yards away&mdash;somepin'
all blue-gray against the hook o' the moon&mdash;an'
began walkin' up an' down an' hollerin'. I
knew it was sayin' words, but I was so far to the
bad I didn't know nothin' an' couldn't make it out.
I never thought a feller's heart could bang so hard
against his ribs without bustin' out, an' me hair
riz so high me campaign hat was three inches off'n
me head. I hope ter the Lord I'll never be so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
frightened again in all my livin' days. I set there
in a transom from fear an' friz ter the spot. I
don't know nothin' o' what Buck was doin', as my
lamps was glued ter the spook. It jumped down
from the wall, callin' an' whistlin' an' begin runnin'
round the little stone heaps. I seen it was
comin' our way, but I couldn't move or make a
sound; I jus' set. All of a suddent Buck he jumps
up an' makes a dash an' a leap at the spook, an'
there's a terrible yellin' an' they both comes down
crash at the foot of a rock pile, rollin' on the little
pebbles; but Buck is on top an' the spook underneath
an' lettin' off the most awful screeches.
Gosh, they jus' ripped the air, them spooks' yells
did, an' they turned my spell loose an' I howled
fer all I was worth. Then Buck, he commenced
a-yawpin' too, but me an' the spook we was both
raisin' so much noise I didn't savvy what he said
fer some time. Then I found he was cussin' me out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Come here, you forsaken &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,' he howls.
'Quit yellin'! I say <i>quit yellin'</i>! Don't yer see
who this is? Come here an' help me.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'You think I'm goin' ter tech that Ming
spook?' I shrieks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'You miser'ble loony,' he yells back, 'can't
yer see it ain't no Ming? It's Ranch!'</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so it was. It was Ranch skeered stiff an'
hollerin' fer dear life at bein' jumped on an' waked
up in the middle of a graveyard that-a-way. Pore
ol' feller had had Daggett on his mind, an' went
sleepwalkin' an' huntin' wrapped in his blanket.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;'An',' says Buck ter me, 'if youse hadn't been
in such a dope dream with skeer, you'd 'a' sensed
what he was a-yellin'. He was callin' &ldquo;Oh-oo-oo,
oh-oo-oo, here Daggett! Here, boy!&rdquo; an' then
he'd whistle an' call again: &ldquo;Here, Daggett! Here,
Daggett!&rdquo; That's how I knew it was Ranch; an',
besides, he told me onct that he sleepwalked when
he got worried. But you, you white livered&mdash;'
an' then he cussed me out some more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Smarty,' I says, 'if yer knew so blame well it
was Ranch, why did yer give him the flyin' tackle
like yer done an' git him all woiked up like this?'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Well,' says Buck sort o' sheepy, 'I was some
woiked up meself, an' time he come along I give
him the spook's tackle without thinkin'; I was too
skeered ter think. Hush, Ranch. Hush, old boy.
It's jus' me'n Bill. Nobody shan't hoit yer.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;We comforted pore ol' Ranch an' fixed him up,
an' then when he felt better told him about things&mdash;all
but how Daggett was et&mdash;an' I wrapped his
blanket around him an' took him back ter quarters
while Buck went a-lookin' fer John an' his gang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He found 'em about half a mile off, in front
of a Mott Street joss house, all prayin' an' burnin'
punk an' huddled together, skeered green from the
yellin's they'd heard. Buck, he give 'em a long
chin-chin about layin' the ghost, an' how Judge
Ming wouldn't never come back no more; an' then
he dragged 'em all back (they pullin' at the halter
shanks with years laid back an' eyes rollin'), ter
him bury his United States button on Ming's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
rock pile. He dropped it in solemn, an' said what
the Chinks took ter be a prayer; but it was really
the oath he said. Buck havin' onct been a recruitin'
sergeant, knew it by heart all the way from
'I do solemnly swear' ter 'so help me, Gawd.'
Buck says I oughter seen them grateful Chinos
then: they'd 'a' give him the whole Chino Umpire
if they could. They got down an' squirmed an'
kissed his hands an' his feet an' his sleeve. They
wanted ter escort him back ter camp, but he
bucked at that, an' said no, as he was out without
pass an' not itchin' fer his arrival ter be noticed
none.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that we took toins watchin' Ranch at
night, an' got him another mutt ter love, an' he
didn't wander any more, so Judge Ming seemed
satisfied with his United States button, an' kep'
quiet. But them Chinks was the gratefullest gang
yer ever seen. They brought us presents; things
ter eat&mdash;fruit, poultry, eggs, an' all sorts of chow,
some of it mighty funny lookin', but it tasted all
right; we lived high, we three. The other fellers
was wild ter know how we woiked it. An' I tell
yer I ain't never been skeered o' ghosts sence&mdash;that
is, not ter speak of&mdash;<i>much</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bill, paused, drew a long breath, and looked at
the clock. &ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;most nine o'clock. I
got ter go over ter K troop ter see Sergeant Keefe
a minute&mdash;I promised him. Adios, fellers.
Thanks fer the smokin'.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep the change, hombre. Thanks for yo'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
tale,&rdquo; shouted Whitney after him as he disappeared
down the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!!&rdquo; said Stone, and looked at Hansen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!!&rdquo; responded Hansen. The big Swede
shook with laughter. &ldquo;Iss he not the finest liar!
Yess? I wass in the Fourteenth myselluf. That
wass my company&mdash;Chay. He wass not even the
army in then&mdash;in nineteen hund'erd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stone, &ldquo;I knew, but I wasn't goin'
to spoil his bloomin' yarn. I happened to see his
enlistment card only this mornin', and the only
thing he was ever in before was the Twenty-third
Infantry after they came back from the Islands.
He's never even been out of the States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where did he get it from?&rdquo; asked Whitney.
&ldquo;His imagination is equal to most anything but
gettin' so many facts straight. Of co'se I noticed
things yere an' there&mdash;but the most of it was
O. K.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Hansen, grinning, &ldquo;he got it
from an old Fourteenth man&mdash;Dan Powerss&mdash;at
practice camp last Chuly. He an' I wass often
talking of China. He wuss in my old company an'
wass then telling me how he an' the other fellerss
all that extra chow got. I tank Bill he hass a goot
memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the nerve of him!&rdquo; cried Whitehall, &ldquo;tryin'
ter pass that off on us with Hansen sittin' right
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It iss one thing he may have forgot,&rdquo; smiled
Hansen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, who cares anyway?&rdquo; said Stone. &ldquo;It
was a blame good story. An' now clear out, all of
you. I want to hit the bunk. Reveille does seem
to come so early these cold mornin's. Gee! I
wish I knew of some kind of button that would
keep <i>me</i> lyin' down when Shorty wants me to get
up an' call the roll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the summit of one of the heights of the Odenwald,
a wild and romantic tract of Upper Germany,
that lies not far from the confluence of the
Main and the Rhine, there stood, many, many
years since, the Castle of the Baron Von Landshort.
It is now quite fallen to decay, and almost
buried among beech trees and dark firs; above
which, however, its old watch tower may still be
seen, struggling, like the former possessor I have
mentioned, to carry a high head, and look down
upon the neighboring country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The baron was a dry branch of the great family
of Katzenellenbogen,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and inherited the relics of
the property, and all the pride of his ancestors.
Though the warlike disposition of his predecessors
had much impaired the family possessions, yet the
baron still endeavored to keep up some show of
former state. The times were peaceable, and the
German nobles, in general, had abandoned their
inconvenient old castles, perched like eagles' nests
among the mountains, and had built more convenient
residences in the valleys; still the baron
remained proudly drawn up in his little fortress,
cherishing with hereditary inveteracy, all the old
family feuds; so that he was on ill terms with some
of his nearest neighbors, on account of disputes
that had happened between their great-great-grandfathers.</p>

<p>The baron had but one child, a daughter; but
nature, when she grants but one child, always
compensates by making it a prodigy; and so it was
with the daughter of the baron. All the nurses,
gossips, and country cousins assured her father
that she had not her equal for beauty in all Germany;
and who should know better than they?
She had, moreover, been brought up with great
care under the superintendence of two maiden
aunts, who had spent some years of their early life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
at one of the little German courts, and were skilled
in all branches of knowledge necessary to the education
of a fine lady. Under their instructions
she became a miracle of accomplishments. By
the time she was eighteen, she could embroider to
admiration, and had worked whole histories of
the saints in tapestry, with such strength of expression
in their countenances, that they looked
like so many souls in purgatory. She could read
without great difficulty, and had spelled her way
through several church legends, and almost all the
chivalric wonders of the Heldenbuch. She had
even made considerable proficiency in writing;
could sign her own name without missing a letter,
and so legibly, that her aunts could read it without
spectacles. She excelled in making little elegant
good-for-nothing lady-like nicknacks of all kinds;
was versed in the most abstruse dancing of the
day; played a number of airs on the harp and
guitar; and knew all the tender ballads of the
Minnelieders by heart.</p>

<p>Her aunts, too, having been great flirts and
coquettes in their younger days, were admirably
calculated to be vigilant guardians and strict
censors of the conduct of their niece; for there is
no duenna so rigidly prudent, and inexorably
decorous, as a superannuated coquette. She was
rarely suffered out of their sight; never went beyond
the domains of the castle, unless well attended,
or rather well watched; had continual
lectures read to her about strict decorum and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
implicit obedience; and, as to the men&mdash;pah!&mdash;she
was taught to hold them at such a distance,
and in such absolute distrust, that, unless properly
authorized, she would not have cast a glance upon
the handsomest cavalier in the world&mdash;no, not
if he were even dying at her feet.</p>

<p>The good effects of this system were wonderfully
apparent. The young lady was a pattern of
docility and correctness. While others were wasting
their sweetness in the glare of the world, and
liable to be plucked and thrown aside by every
hand, she was coyly blooming into fresh and lovely
womanhood under the protection of those immaculate
spinsters, like a rosebud blushing forth among
guardian thorns. Her aunts looked upon her with
pride and exultation, and vaunted that though all
the other young ladies in the world might go
astray, yet, thank Heaven, nothing of the kind
could happen to the heiress of Katzenellenbogen.</p>

<p>But, however scantily the Baron Von Landshort
might be provided with children, his household
was by no means a small one; for Providence had
enriched him with abundance of poor relations.
They, one and all, possessed the affectionate disposition
common to humble relatives; were wonderfully
attached to the baron, and took every
possible occasion to come in swarms and enliven the
castle. All family festivals were commemorated
by these good people at the baron's expense; and
when they were filled with good cheer, they would
declare that there was nothing on earth so delightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
as these family meetings, these jubilees of the
heart.</p>

<p>The baron, though a small man, had a large
soul, and it swelled with satisfaction at the consciousness
of being the greatest man in the little
world about him. He loved to tell long stories
about the dark old warriors whose portraits looked
grimly down from the walls around, and he found
no listeners equal to those that fed at his expense.
He was much given to the marvelous, and a firm
believer in all those supernatural tales with which
every mountain and valley in Germany abounds.
The faith of his guests exceeded even his own: they
listened to every tale of wonder with open eyes
and mouth, and never failed to be astonished, even
though repeated for the hundredth time. Thus
lived the Baron Von Landshort, the oracle of his
table, the absolute monarch of his little territory,
and happy, above all things, in the persuasion that
he was the wisest man of the age.</p>

<p>At the time of which my story treats, there was
a great family gathering at the castle, on an affair
of the utmost importance: it was to receive the
destined bridegroom of the baron's daughter. A
negotiation had been carried on between the
father and an old nobleman of Bavaria, to unite
the dignity of their houses by the marriage of their
children. The preliminaries had been conducted
with proper punctilio. The young people were
betrothed without seeing each other, and the time
was appointed for the marriage ceremony. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
young Count Von Altenburg had been recalled
from the army for the purpose, and was actually
on his way to the baron's to receive his bride.
Missives had even been received from him from
Wurtzburg, where he was accidentally detained,
mentioning the day and hour when he might be
expected to arrive.</p>

<p>The castle was in a tumult of preparation to
give him a suitable welcome. The fair bride had
been decked out with uncommon care. The two
aunts had superintended her toilet, and quarreled
the whole morning about every article of her
dress. The young lady had taken advantage of
their contest to follow the bent of her own taste;
and fortunately it was a good one. She looked as
lovely as youthful bridegroom could desire; and
the flutter of expectation heightened the luster
of her charms.</p>

<p>The suffusions that mantled her face and neck,
the gentle heaving of the bosom, the eye now and
then lost in reverie, all betrayed the soft tumult
that was going on in her little heart. The aunts
were continually hovering around her; for maiden
aunts are apt to take great interest in affairs of
this nature. They were giving her a world of
staid counsel how to deport herself, what to say,
and in what manner to receive the expected lover.</p>

<p>The baron was no less busied in preparations.
He had, in truth, nothing exactly to do; but he
was naturally a fuming bustling little man, and
could not remain passive when all the world was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
in a hurry. He worried from top to bottom of the
castle with an air of infinite anxiety; he continually
called the servants from their work to exhort
them to be diligent; and buzzed about every hall
and chamber, as idly restless and importunate as
a blue-bottle fly on a warm summer's day.</p>

<p>In the meantime the fatted calf had been killed;
the forests had rung with the clamor of the huntsmen;
the kitchen was crowded with good cheer;
the cellars had yielded up whole oceans of <i>Rheinwein</i>
and <i>Fernewein</i>; and even the great Heidelberg
tun had been laid under contribution.
Everything was ready to receive the distinguished
guest with <i>Saus und Braus</i> in the true spirit of
German hospitality&mdash;but the guest delayed to
make his appearance. Hour rolled after hour.
The sun, that had poured his downward rays upon
the rich forest of the Odenwald, now just gleamed
along the summits of the mountains. The baron
mounted the highest tower, and strained his eyes
in hope of catching a distant sight of the count
and his attendants. Once he thought he beheld
them; the sounds of horns came floating from the
valley, prolonged by the mountain echoes. A
number of horsemen were seen far below, slowly
advancing along the road; but when they had
nearly reached the foot of the mountain, they
suddenly struck off in a different direction. The
last ray of sunshine departed&mdash;the bats began to
flit by in the twilight&mdash;the road grew dimmer and
dimmer to the view; and nothing appeared stirring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
in it but now and then a peasant lagging homeward
from his labor.</p>

<p>While the old castle at Landshort was in this
state of perplexity, a very interesting scene was
transacting in a different part of the Odenwald.</p>

<p>The young Count Von Altenburg was tranquilly
pursuing his route in that sober jog-trot way in
which a man travels toward matrimony when his
friends have taken all the trouble and uncertainty
of courtship off his hands, and a bride is waiting
for him, as certainly as a dinner at the end of his
journey. He had encountered at Wurtzburg a
youthful companion in arms with whom he had
seen some service on the frontiers: Herman Von
Starkenfaust, one of the stoutest hands and
worthiest hearts of German chivalry, who was
now returning from the army. His father's
castle was not far distant from the old fortress of
Landshort, although an hereditary feud rendered
the families hostile, and strangers to each other.</p>

<p>In the warm-hearted moment of recognition,
the young friends related all their past adventures
and fortunes, and the count gave the whole
history of his intended nuptials with a young
lady whom he had never seen, but of whose
charms he had received the most enrapturing
descriptions.</p>

<p>As the route of the friends lay in the same direction,
they agreed to perform the rest of their
journey together; and, that they might do it the
more leisurely, set off from Wurtzburg at an early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
hour, the count having given directions for his
retinue to follow and overtake him.</p>

<p>They beguiled their wayfaring with recollections
of their military scenes and adventures; but
the count was apt to be a little tedious, now and
then, about the reputed charms of his bride and
the felicity that awaited him.</p>

<p>In this way they had entered among the mountains
of the Odenwald, and were traversing one of
its most lonely and thickly wooded passes. It is
well known that the forests of Germany have
always been as much infested by robbers as its
castles by specters; and at this time the former
were particularly numerous, from the hordes of
disbanded soldiers wandering about the country.
It will not appear extraordinary, therefore, that
the cavaliers were attacked by a gang of these
stragglers, in the midst of the forest. They defended
themselves with bravery, but were nearly
overpowered, when the count's retinue arrived
to their assistance. At sight of them the robbers
fled, but not until the count had received a mortal
wound. He was slowly and carefully conveyed
back to the city of Wurtzburg, and a friar summoned
from a neighboring convent who was
famous for his skill in administering to both soul
and body; but half of his skill was superfluous; the
moments of the unfortunate count were numbered.</p>

<p>With his dying breath he entreated his friend
to repair instantly to the castle of Landshort, and
explain the fatal cause of his not keeping his appointment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
with his bride. Though not the most
ardent of lovers, he was one of the most punctilious
of men, and appeared earnestly solicitous that
his mission should be speedily and courteously
executed. &ldquo;Unless this is done,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall
not sleep quietly in my grave!&rdquo; He repeated
these last words with peculiar solemnity. A request,
at a moment so impressive, admitted no
hesitation. Starkenfaust endeavored to soothe
him to calmness; promised faithfully to execute
his wish, and gave him his hand in solemn pledge.
The dying man pressed it in acknowledgment,
but soon lapsed into delirium&mdash;raved about his
bride&mdash;his engagements&mdash;his plighted word;
ordered his horse, that he might ride to the castle
of Landshort; and expired in the fancied act of
vaulting into the saddle.</p>

<p>Starkenfaust bestowed a sigh and a soldier's
tear on the untimely fate of his comrade, and then
pondered on the awkward mission he had undertaken.
His heart was heavy, and his head perplexed;
for he was to present himself an unbidden
guest among hostile people, and to damp their
festivity with tidings fatal to their hopes. Still,
there were certain whisperings of curiosity in his
bosom to see this far-famed beauty of Katzenellenbogen,
so cautiously shut up from the world; for
he was a passionate admirer of the sex, and there
was a dash of eccentricity and enterprise in his
character that made him fond of all singular
adventure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Previous to his departure he made all due arrangements
with the holy fraternity of the convent
for the funeral solemnities of his friend,
who was to be buried in the cathedral of Wurtzburg
near some of his illustrious relatives; and
the mourning retinue of the count took charge of
his remains.</p>

<p>It is now high time that we should return to the
ancient family of Katzenellenbogen, who were
impatient for their guest, and still more for their
dinner; and to the worthy little baron, whom we
left airing himself on the watch-tower.</p>

<p>Night closed in, but still no guest arrived. The
baron descended from the tower in despair. The
banquet, which had been delayed from hour to
hour, could no longer be postponed. The meats
were already overdone; the cook in an agony;
and the whole household had the look of a garrison
that had been reduced by famine. The baron
was obliged reluctantly to give orders for the feast
without the presence of the guest. All were
seated at table, and just on the point of commencing,
when the sound of a horn from without the
gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger.
Another long blast filled the old courts of the castle
with its echoes, and was answered by the warder
from the walls. The baron hastened to receive
his future son-in-law.</p>

<p>The drawbridge had been let down, and the
stranger was before the gate. He was a tall,
gallant cavalier mounted on a black steed. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
countenance was pale, but he had a beaming,
romantic eye, and an air of stately melancholy.</p>

<p>The baron was a little mortified that he should
have come in this simple, solitary style. His
dignity for a moment was ruffled, and he felt disposed
to consider it a want of proper respect for
the important occasion, and the important family
with which he was to be connected. He pacified
himself, however, with the conclusion, that it must
have been youthful impatience which had induced
him thus to spur on sooner than his attendants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;to break in
upon you thus unseasonably&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the baron interrupted with a world of
compliments and greetings; for, to tell the truth,
he prided himself upon his courtesy and eloquence.</p>

<p>The stranger attempted, once or twice, to stem
the torrent of words, but in vain, so he bowed his
head and suffered it to flow on. By the time the
baron had come to a pause, they had reached the
inner court of the castle; and the stranger was
again about to speak, when he was once more interrupted
by the appearance of the female part of
the family leading forth the shrinking and blushing
bride. He gazed on her for a moment as one
entranced; it seemed as if his whole soul beamed
forth in the gaze, and rested upon that lovely form.
One of the maiden aunts whispered something in
her ear; she made an effort to speak; her moist
blue eye was timidly raised; gave a shy glance of
inquiry on the stranger; and was cast again to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
ground. The words died away; but there was a
sweet smile playing about her lips, and a soft
dimpling of the cheek that showed her glance had
not been unsatisfactory. It was impossible for a
girl of the fond age of eighteen, highly predisposed
for love and matrimony, not to be pleased with so
gallant a cavalier.</p>

<p>The late hour at which the guest had arrived
left no time for parley. The baron was peremptory,
and deferred all particular conversation until
the morning, and led the way to the untasted
banquet.</p>

<p>It was served up in the great hall of the castle.
Around the walls hung the hard-favored portraits
of the heroes of the house of Katzenellenbogen, and
the trophies which they had gained in the field
and in the chase. Hacked corselets, splintered
jousting spears, and tattered banners were mingled
with the spoils of sylvan warfare; the jaws of the
wolf and the tusks of the boar grinned horribly
among cross-bows and battle-axes, and a huge
pair of antlers branched immediately over the
head of the youthful bridegroom.</p>

<p>The cavalier took but little notice of the company
or the entertainment. He scarcely tasted
the banquet, but seemed absorbed in admiration
of his bride. He conversed in a low tone that could
not be overheard&mdash;for the language of love is
never loud; but where is the female ear so dull
that it cannot catch the softest whisper of the
lover? There was a mingled tenderness and gravity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
in his manner, that appeared to have a powerful
effect upon the young lady. Her color came
and went as she listened with deep attention.
Now and then she made some blushing reply, and
when his eye was turned away, she would steal a
sidelong glance at his romantic countenance and
heave a gentle sigh of tender happiness. It was
evident that the young couple were completely
enamored. The aunts, who were deeply versed
in the mysteries of the heart, declared that they
had fallen in love with each other at first sight.</p>

<p>The feast went on merrily, or at least noisily,
for the guests were all blessed with those keen
appetites that attend upon light purses and mountain
air. The baron told his best and longest
stories, and never had he told them so well, or
with such great effect. If there was anything
marvelous, his auditors were lost in astonishment;
and if anything facetious, they were sure to
laugh exactly in the right place. The baron, it is
true, like most great men, was too dignified to
utter any joke but a dull one; it was always enforced,
however, by a bumper of excellent Hockheimer;
and even a dull joke, at one's own table,
served up with jolly old wine, is irresistible. Many
good things were said by poorer and keener wits
that would not bear repeating, except on similar
occasions; many sly speeches whispered in ladies'
ears, that almost convulsed them with suppressed
laughter; and a song or two roared out by a poor,
but merry and broad-faced cousin of the baron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
that absolutely made the maiden aunts hold up
their fans.</p>

<p>Amidst all this revelry, the stranger guest maintained
a most singular and unseasonable gravity.
His countenance assumed a deeper cast of dejection
as the evening advanced; and, strange as it
may appear, even the baron's jokes seemed only
to render him the more melancholy. At times he
was lost in thought, and at times there was a perturbed
and restless wandering of the eye that
bespoke a mind but ill at ease. His conversations
with the bride became more and more earnest and
mysterious. Lowering clouds began to steal over
the fair serenity of her brow, and tremors to run
through her tender frame.</p>

<p>All this could not escape the notice of the company.
Their gayety was chilled by the unaccountable
gloom of the bridegroom; their spirits were
infected; whispers and glances were interchanged,
accompanied by shrugs and dubious shakes of the
head. The song and the laugh grew less and less
frequent; there were dreary pauses in the conversation,
which were at length succeeded by wild tales
and supernatural legends. One dismal story produced
another still more dismal, and the baron
nearly frightened some of the ladies into hysterics
with the history of the goblin horseman that carried
away the fair Leonora; a dreadful story
which has since been put into excellent verse, and
is read and believed by all the world.</p>

<p>The bridegroom listened to this tale with profound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
attention. He kept his eyes steadily fixed
on the baron, and, as the story drew to a close,
began gradually to rise from his seat, growing
taller and taller, until, in the baron's entranced
eye, he seemed almost to tower into a giant. The
moment the tale was finished, he heaved a deep
sigh and took a solemn farewell of the company.
They were all amazement. The baron was perfectly
thunder-struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! going to leave the castle at midnight?
Why, everything was prepared for his reception; a
chamber was ready for him if he wished to retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head mournfully and
mysteriously; &ldquo;I must lay my head in a different
chamber to-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something in this reply, and the tone
in which it was uttered, that made the baron's
heart misgive him; but he rallied his forces and
repeated his hospitable entreaties.</p>

<p>The stranger shook his head silently, but positively,
at every offer; and, waving his farewell
to the company, stalked slowly out of the
hall. The maiden aunts were absolutely petrified&mdash;the
bride hung her head, and a tear stole to her
eye.</p>

<p>The baron followed the stranger to the great
court of the castle, where the black charger stood
pawing the earth and snorting with impatience.
When they had reached the portal, whose deep
archway was dimly lighted by a cresset, the
stranger paused, and addressed the baron in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
hollow tone of voice which the vaulted roof rendered
still more sepulchral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that we are alone,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will impart
to you the reason of my going. I have a solemn,
an indispensable engagement&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the baron, &ldquo;cannot you send someone
in your place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It admits of no substitute&mdash;I must attend it
in person&mdash;I must away to Wurtzburg cathedral&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the baron, plucking up spirit, &ldquo;but
not until to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow you shall take
your bride there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; replied the stranger, with tenfold
solemnity, &ldquo;my engagement is with no bride&mdash;the
worms! the worms expect me! I am a dead
man&mdash;I have been slain by robbers&mdash;my body lies
at Wurtzburg&mdash;at midnight I am to be buried&mdash;the
grave is waiting for me&mdash;I must keep my
appointment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sprang on his black charger, dashed over the
drawbridge, and the clattering of his horses' hoofs
was lost in the whistling of the night blast.</p>

<p>The baron returned to the hall in the utmost
consternation, and related what had passed. Two
ladies fainted outright, others sickened at the idea
of having banqueted with a specter. It was the
opinion of some, that this might be the wild huntsman,
famous in German legend. Some talked of
mountain sprites, of wood-demons, and of other
supernatural beings, with which the good people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
of Germany have been so grievously harassed since
time immemorial. One of the poor relations ventured
to suggest that it might be some sportive
evasion of the young cavalier, and that the very
gloominess of the caprice seemed to accord with
so melancholy a personage. This, however, drew
on him the indignation of the whole company, and
especially of the baron, who looked upon him as
little better than an infidel; so that he was fain to
abjure his heresy as speedily as possible, and come
into the faith of the true believers.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the doubts entertained,
they were completely put to an end by the
arrival, next day, of regular missives confirming
the intelligence of the young count's murder, and
his interment in Wurtzburg cathedral.</p>

<p>The dismay at the castle may well be imagined.
The baron shut himself up in his chamber. The
guests, who had come to rejoice with him, could
not think of abandoning him in his distress. They
wandered about the courts, or collected in groups
in the hall, shaking their heads and shrugging
their shoulders at the troubles of so good a man;
and sat longer than ever at table, and ate and
drank more stoutly than ever, by way of keeping
up their spirits. But the situation of the widowed
bride was the most pitiable. To have lost a husband
before she had even embraced him&mdash;and
such a husband! if the very specter could be so
gracious and noble, what must have been the living
man! She filled the house with lamentations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>On the night of the second day of her widowhood,
she had retired to her chamber, accompanied
by one of her aunts who insisted on sleeping with
her. The aunt, who was one of the best tellers
of ghost stories in all Germany, had just been
recounting one of her longest, and had fallen
asleep in the very midst of it. The chamber was
remote, and overlooked a small garden. The
niece lay pensively gazing at the beams of the
rising moon, as they trembled on the leaves of
an aspen-tree before the lattice. The castle-clock
had just tolled midnight, when a soft strain of
music stole up from the garden. She rose hastily
from her bed, and stepped lightly to the window.
A tall figure stood among the shadows of the trees.
As it raised its head, a beam of moonlight fell upon
the countenance. Heaven and earth! she beheld
the Specter Bridegroom! A loud shriek at that
moment burst upon her ear, and her aunt, who
had been awakened by the music, and had followed
her silently to the window, fell into her arms.
When she looked again, the specter had disappeared.</p>

<p>Of the two females, the aunt now required the
most soothing, for she was perfectly beside herself
with terror. As to the young lady, there was
something, even in the specter of her lover, that
seemed endearing. There was still the semblance
of manly beauty; and though the shadow of a man
is but little calculated to satisfy the affections of a
love-sick girl, yet, where the substance is not to be
had, even that is consoling. The aunt declared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
she would never sleep in that chamber again; the
niece, for once, was refractory, and declared as
strongly that she would sleep in no other in the
castle: the consequence was, that she had to sleep
in it alone: but she drew a promise from her aunt
not to relate the story of the specter, lest she
should be denied the only melancholy pleasure
left her on earth&mdash;that of inhabiting the chamber
over which the guardian shade of her lover kept
its nightly vigils.</p>

<p>How long the good old lady would have observed
this promise is uncertain, for she dearly
loved to talk of the marvelous, and there is a
triumph in being the first to tell a frightful story;
it is, however, still quoted in the neighborhood, as
a memorable instance of female secrecy, that she
kept it to herself for a whole week; when she was
suddenly absolved from all further restraint, by
intelligence, brought to the breakfast table one
morning, that the young lady was not to be
found. Her room was empty&mdash;the bed had not
been slept in&mdash;the window was open, and the bird
had flown!</p>

<p>The astonishment and concern with which the
intelligence was received, can only be imagined
by those who have witnessed the agitation which
the mishaps of a great man cause among his
friends. Even the poor relations paused for a
moment from the indefatigable labors of the
trencher, when the aunt, who had at first been
struck speechless, wrung her hands, and shrieked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
out, &ldquo;The goblin! the goblin! She's carried away
by the goblin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few words she related the fearful scene of
the garden, and concluded that the specter must
have carried off his bride. Two of the domestics
corroborated the opinion, for they had heard the
clattering of a horse's hoofs down the mountain
about midnight, and had no doubt that it was the
specter on his black charger, bearing her away to
the tomb. All present were struck with the direful
probability; for events of the kind are extremely
common in Germany, as many well-authenticated
histories bear witness.</p>

<p>What a lamentable situation was that of the
poor baron! What a heart-rending dilemma for a
fond father, and a member of the great family of
Katzenellenbogen! His only daughter had either
been rapt away to the grave, or he was to have
some wood-demon for a son-in-law, and, perchance,
a troop of goblin grandchildren. As
usual, he was completely bewildered and all the
castle in an uproar. The men were ordered to take
horse, and scour every road and path and glen of
the Odenwald. The baron himself had just drawn
on his jack-boots, girded on his sword, and was
about to mount his steed to sally forth on the
doubtful quest, when he was brought to a pause
by a new apparition. A lady was seen approaching
the castle, mounted on a palfrey, attended by
a cavalier on horseback. She galloped up to the
gate, sprang from her horse, and falling at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
baron's feet, embraced his knees. It was his lost
daughter, and her companion&mdash;the Specter Bridegroom!
The baron was astounded. He looked
at his daughter, then at the specter, and almost
doubted the evidence of his senses. The latter,
too, was wonderfully improved in his appearance
since his visit to the world of spirits. His dress
was splendid, and set off a noble figure of manly
symmetry. He was no longer pale and melancholy.
His fine countenance was flushed with the
glow of youth, and joy rioted in his large dark eye.</p>

<p>The mystery was soon cleared up. The cavalier
(for in truth, as you must have known all the
while, he was no goblin) announced himself as Sir
Herman Von Starkenfaust. He related his adventure
with the young count. He told how he
had hastened to the castle to deliver the unwelcome
tidings, but that the eloquence of the baron
had interrupted him in every attempt to tell his
tale. How the sight of the bride had completely
captivated him, and that to pass a few hours near
her, he had tacitly suffered the mistake to continue.
How he had been sorely perplexed in what
way to make a decent retreat, until the baron's
goblin stories had suggested his eccentric exit.
How, fearing the feudal hostility of the family, he
had repeated his visits by stealth&mdash;had haunted
the garden beneath the young lady's window&mdash;had
wooed&mdash;had won&mdash;had borne away in triumph&mdash;and,
in a word, had wedded the fair.</p>

<p>Under any other circumstances the baron would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
have been inflexible, for he was tenacious of paternal
authority, and devoutly obstinate in all
family feuds; but he loved his daughter; he had
lamented her as lost; he rejoiced to find her still
alive; and, though her husband was of a hostile
house, yet, thank Heaven, he was not a goblin.
There was something, it must be acknowledged,
that did not exactly accord with his notions of
strict veracity, in the joke the knight had passed
upon him of his being a dead man; but several old
friends present, who had served in the wars, assured
him that every stratagem was excusable in
love, and that the cavalier was entitled to especial
privilege, having lately served as a trooper.</p>

<p>Matters, therefore, were happily arranged. The
baron pardoned the young couple on the spot.
The revels at the castle were resumed. The poor
relations overwhelmed this new member of the
family with loving kindness; he was so gallant, so
generous&mdash;and so rich. The aunts, it is true, were
somewhat scandalized that their system of strict
seclusion and passive obedience should be so badly
exemplified, but attributed it all to their negligence
in not having the windows grated. One of
them was particularly mortified at having her
marvelous story marred, and that the only
specter she had ever seen should turn out a counterfeit;
but the niece seemed perfectly happy at
having found him substantial flesh and blood&mdash;and
so the story ends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very odd, though; what can have become
of them?&rdquo; said Charles Seaforth, as he peeped
under the valance of an old-fashioned bedstead,
in an old-fashioned apartment of a still more old-fashioned
manor-house; &ldquo;'tis confoundedly odd,
and I can't make it out at all. Why, Barney,
where are they?&mdash;and where the d&mdash;&mdash;l are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer was returned to this appeal; and the
lieutenant, who was, in the main, a reasonable
person&mdash;at least as reasonable a person as any
young gentleman of twenty-two in &ldquo;the service&rdquo;
can fairly be expected to be&mdash;cooled when he reflected
that his servant could scarcely reply
extempore to a summons which it was impossible
he should hear.</p>

<p>An application to the bell was the considerate
result; and the footsteps of as tight a lad as ever
put pipe-clay to belt sounded along the gallery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said his master. An ineffectual
attempt upon the door reminded Mr. Seaforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
that he had locked himself in. &ldquo;By Heaven! this
is the oddest thing of all,&rdquo; said he, as he turned
the key and admitted Mr. Maguire into his
dormitory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barney, where are my pantaloons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it the breeches?&rdquo; asked the valet, casting
an inquiring eye round the apartment;&mdash;&ldquo;is it the
breeches, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what have you done with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure then your honor had them on when you
went to bed, and it's hereabouts they'll be, I'll be
bail&rdquo;; and Barney lifted a fashionable tunic from
a cane-backed arm-chair, proceeding in his examination.
But the search was vain; there was
the tunic aforesaid, there was a smart-looking
kerseymere waistcoat; but the most important
article of all in a gentleman's wardrobe was still
wanting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where <i>can</i> they be?&rdquo; asked the master, with a
strong accent on the auxiliary verb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorrow a know I knows,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>must</i> have been the devil, then, after all,
who has been here and carried them off!&rdquo; cried
Seaforth, staring full into Barney's face.</p>

<p>Mr. Maguire was not devoid of the superstition
of his countrymen, still he looked as if he did not
quite subscribe to the <i>sequitur</i>.</p>

<p>His master read incredulity in his countenance.
&ldquo;Why, I tell you, Barney, I put them there, on
that arm-chair, when I got into bed; and, by
Heaven! I distinctly saw the ghost of the old fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
they told me of, come in at midnight, put on
my pantaloons, and walk away with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; was the cautious reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought, of course, it was a dream; but then&mdash;where
the d&mdash;&mdash;l are the breeches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question was more easily asked than answered.
Barney renewed his search, while the
lieutenant folded his arms, and, leaning against
the toilet, sunk into a reverie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, it must be some trick of my laughter-loving
cousins,&rdquo; said Seaforth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! then, the ladies!&rdquo; chimed in Mr. Maguire,
though the observation was not addressed to him;
&ldquo;and will it be Miss Caroline or Miss Fanny,
that's stole your honor's things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what to think of it,&rdquo; pursued
the bereaved lieutenant, still speaking in soliloquy,
with his eye resting dubiously on the chamber-door.
&ldquo;I locked myself in, that's certain; and&mdash;but
there must be some other entrance to the room&mdash;pooh!
I remember&mdash;the private staircase; how
could I be such a fool?&rdquo; and he crossed the chamber
to where a low oaken doorcase was dimly
visible in a distant corner. He paused before it.
Nothing now interfered to screen it from observation;
but it bore tokens of having been at some
earlier period concealed by tapestry, remains of
which yet clothed the walls on either side the portal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way they must have come,&rdquo; said Seaforth;
&ldquo;I wish with all my heart I had caught
them!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Och! the kittens!&rdquo; sighed Mr. Barney
Maguire.</p>

<p>But the mystery was yet as far from being
solved as before. True, there <i>was</i> the &ldquo;other
door&rdquo;; but then that, too, on examination, was
even more firmly secured than the one which
opened on the gallery&mdash;two heavy bolts on the
inside effectually prevented any <i>coup de main</i> on
the lieutenant's <i>bivouac</i> from that quarter. He
was more puzzled than ever; nor did the minutest
inspection of the walls and floor throw any light
upon the subject: one thing only was clear&mdash;the
breeches were gone! &ldquo;It is <i>very</i> singular,&rdquo; said
the lieutenant.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Tappington (generally called Tapton) Everard
is an antiquated but commodious manor-house in
the eastern division of the county of Kent. A
former proprietor had been high-sheriff in the
days of Elizabeth, and many a dark and dismal
tradition was yet extant of the licentiousness of
his life, and the enormity of his offenses. The
Glen, which the keeper's daughter was seen to
enter, but never known to quit, still frowns darkly
as of yore; while an ineradicable blood-stain on
the oaken stair yet bids defiance to the united
energies of soap and sand. But it is with one
particular apartment that a deed of more especial
atrocity is said to be connected. A stranger
guest&mdash;so runs the legend&mdash;arrived unexpectedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
at the mansion of the &ldquo;Bad Sir Giles.&rdquo; They met
in apparent friendship; but the ill-concealed scowl
on their master's brow told the domestics that
the visit was not a welcome one; the banquet,
however, was not spared; the wine-cup circulated
freely&mdash;too freely, perhaps&mdash;for sounds of discord
at length reached the ears of even the excluded
serving-men, as they were doing their best to
imitate their betters in the lower hall. Alarmed,
some of them ventured to approach the parlor,
one, an old and favored retainer of the house, went
so far as to break in upon his master's privacy.
Sir Giles, already high in oath, fiercely enjoined
his absence, and he retired; not, however, before
he had distinctly heard from the stranger's lips
a menace that &ldquo;there was that within his pocket
which could disprove the knight's right to issue
that or any other command within the walls of
Tapton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intrusion, though momentary, seemed to
have produced a beneficial effect; the voices of the
disputants fell, and the conversation was carried
on thenceforth in a more subdued tone, till, as
evening closed in, the domestics, when summoned
to attend with lights, found not only cordiality
restored, but that a still deeper carouse was meditated.
Fresh stoups, and from the choicest bins,
were produced; nor was it till at a late, or rather
early hour, that the revelers sought their
chambers.</p>

<p>The one allotted to the stranger occupied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
first floor of the eastern angle of the building, and
had once been the favorite apartment of Sir Giles
himself. Scandal ascribed this preference to the
facility which a private staircase, communicating
with the grounds, had afforded him, in the old
knight's time, of following his wicked courses
unchecked by parental observation; a consideration
which ceased to be of weight when the death
of his father left him uncontrolled master of his
estate and actions. From that period Sir Giles
had established himself in what were called the
&ldquo;state apartments,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;oaken chamber&rdquo;
was rarely tenanted, save on occasions of extraordinary
festivity, or when the yule log drew an
unusually large accession of guests around the
Christmas hearth.</p>

<p>On this eventful night it was prepared for the
unknown visitor, who sought his couch heated and
inflamed from his midnight orgies, and in the
morning was found in his bed a swollen and
blackened corpse. No marks of violence appeared
upon the body; but the livid hue of the lips, and
certain dark-colored spots visible on the skin,
aroused suspicions which those who entertained
them were too timid to express. Apoplexy, induced
by the excesses of the preceding night, Sir
Giles's confidential leech pronounced to be the
cause of his sudden dissolution. The body was
buried in peace; and though some shook their heads
as they witnessed the haste with which the funeral
rites were hurried on, none ventured to murmur.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
Other events arose to distract the attention of the
retainers; men's minds became occupied by the
stirring politics of the day; while the near approach
of that formidable armada, so vainly arrogating
itself a title which the very elements joined with
human valor to disprove, soon interfered to
weaken, if not obliterate, all remembrance of the
nameless stranger who had died within the walls
of Tapton Everard.</p>

<p>Years rolled on: the &ldquo;Bad Sir Giles&rdquo; had himself
long since gone to his account, the last, as it
was believed, of his immediate line; though a few
of the older tenants were sometimes heard to speak
of an elder brother, who had disappeared in early
life, and never inherited the estate. Rumors, too,
of his having left a son in foreign lands, were at
one time rife; but they died away, nothing occurring
to support them: the property passed unchallenged
to a collateral branch of the family,
and the secret, if secret there were, was buried in
Denton churchyard, in the lonely grave of the
mysterious stranger. One circumstance alone
occurred, after a long-intervening period, to revive
the memory of these transactions. Some workmen
employed in grubbing an old plantation,
for the purpose of raising on its site a modern
shrubbery, dug up, in the execution of their task,
the mildewed remnants of what seemed to have
been once a garment. On more minute inspection,
enough remained of silken slashes and a coarse
embroidery, to identify the relics as having once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
formed part of a pair of trunk hose; while a few
papers which fell from them, altogether illegible
from damp and age, were by the unlearned rustics
conveyed to the then owner of the estate.</p>

<p>Whether the squire was more successful in deciphering
them was never known; he certainly
never alluded to their contents; and little would
have been thought of the matter but for the inconvenient
memory of one old woman, who declared
she heard her grandfather say, that when
the &ldquo;strange guest&rdquo; was poisoned, though all the
rest of his clothes were there, his breeches, the
supposed repository of the supposed documents,
could never be found. The master of Tapton
Everard smiled when he heard Dame Jones's hint
of deeds which might impeach the validity of his
own title in favor of some unknown descendant of
some unknown heir; and the story was rarely
alluded to, save by one or two miracle-mongers,
who had heard that others had seen the ghost of
old Sir Giles, in his night-cap, issue from the
postern, enter the adjoining copse, and wring
his shadowy hands in agony, as he seemed to
search vainly for something hidden among the
evergreens. The stranger's death-room had, of
course, been occasionally haunted from the time
of his decease; but the periods of visitation had
latterly become very rare&mdash;even Mrs. Botherby,
the housekeeper, being forced to admit that, during
her long sojourn at the manor, she had never
&ldquo;met with anything worse than herself&rdquo;; though,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
as the old lady afterwards added upon more mature
reflection, &ldquo;I must say I think I saw the devil
<i>once</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the legend attached to Tapton
Everard, and such the story which the lively
Caroline Ingoldsby detailed to her equally mercurial
cousin, Charles Seaforth, lieutenant in the
Hon. East India Company's second regiment of
Bombay Fencibles, as arm-in-arm they promenaded
a gallery decked with some dozen grim-looking
ancestral portraits, and, among others,
with that of the redoubted Sir Giles himself.
The gallant commander had that very morning
paid his first visit to the house of his maternal
uncle, after an absence of several years passed
with his regiment on the arid plains of Hindostan,
whence he was now returned on a three years'
furlough. He had gone out a boy&mdash;he returned a
man; but the impression made upon his youthful
fancy by his favorite cousin remained unimpaired,
and to Tapton he directed his steps, even before he
sought the home of his widowed mother&mdash;comforting
himself in this breach of filial decorum by
the reflection that, as the manor was so little out
of his way, it would be unkind to pass, as it were,
the door of his relatives, without just looking in
for a few hours.</p>

<p>But he found his uncle as hospitable, and his
cousin more charming than ever; and the looks of
one, and the requests of the other, soon precluded
the possibility of refusing to lengthen the &ldquo;few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
hours&rdquo; into a few days, though the house was at
the moment full of visitors.</p>

<p>The Peterses were from Ramsgate; and Mr.,
Mrs., and the two Miss Simpkinsons, from Bath,
had come to pass a month with the family; and
Tom Ingoldsby had brought down his college
friend the Honorable Augustus Sucklethumbkin,
with his groom and pointers, to take a fortnight's
shooting. And then there was Mrs. Ogleton, the
rich young widow, with her large black eyes, who,
people did say, was setting her cap at the young
squire, though Mrs. Botherby did not believe it;
and, above all, there was Mademoiselle Pauline,
her <i>femme de chambre</i>, who &ldquo;<i>mon-Dieu'd</i>&rdquo; everything
and everybody, and cried &ldquo;<i>Quel horreur!</i>&rdquo;
at Mrs. Botherby's cap. In short, to use the last-named
and much-respected lady's own expression,
the house was &ldquo;choke-full&rdquo; to the very attics&mdash;all
save the &ldquo;oaken chamber,&rdquo; which, as the
lieutenant expressed a most magnanimous disregard
of ghosts, was forthwith appropriated to his
particular accommodation. Mr. Maguire meanwhile
was fain to share the apartment of Oliver
Dobbs, the squire's own man; a jocular proposal
of joint occupancy having been first indignantly
rejected by &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; though preferred
with the &ldquo;laste taste in life&rdquo; of Mr. Barney's most
insinuating brogue.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;Come, Charles, the urn is absolutely getting
cold; your breakfast will be quite spoiled: what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
can have made you so idle?&rdquo; Such was the morning
salutation of Miss Ingoldsby to the <i>militaire</i>
as he entered the breakfast-room half an hour after
the latest of the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty gentleman, truly, to make an appointment
with,&rdquo; chimed in Miss Frances. &ldquo;What is become
of our ramble to the rocks before breakfast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! the young men never think of keeping a
promise now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peters, a little ferret-faced
woman with underdone eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a young man,&rdquo; said Mr. Peters,
&ldquo;I remember I always made a point of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, how long ago was that?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Simpkinson from Bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, when I married Mrs. Peters, I was&mdash;let
me see&mdash;I was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do pray hold your tongue, P., and eat your
breakfast!&rdquo; interrupted his better half, who had
a mortal horror of chronological references; &ldquo;it's
very rude to tease people with your family affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lieutenant had by this time taken his seat
in silence&mdash;a good-humored nod, and a glance,
half-smiling, half-inquisitive, being the extent of
his salutation. Smitten as he was, and in the
immediate presence of her who had made so large
a hole in his heart, his manner was evidently <i>distrait</i>,
which the fair Caroline in her secret soul
attributed to his being solely occupied by her
<i>agr&egrave;mens</i>: how would she have bridled had she
known that they only shared his meditations with
a pair of breeches!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles drank his coffee and spiked some half-dozen
eggs, darting occasionally a penetrating
glance at the ladies, in hope of detecting the supposed
waggery by the evidence of some furtive
smile or conscious look. But in vain; not a dimple
moved indicative of roguery, nor did the slightest
elevation of eyebrow rise confirmative of his suspicions.
Hints and insinuations passed unheeded&mdash;more
particular inquiries were out of the question&mdash;the
subject was unapproachable.</p>

<p>In the meantime, &ldquo;patent cords&rdquo; were just the
thing for a morning's ride; and, breakfast ended,
away cantered the party over the downs, till, every
faculty absorbed by the beauties, animate and
inanimate, which surrounded him. Lieutenant
Seaforth of the Bombay Fencibles bestowed no
more thought upon his breeches than if he had
been born on the top of Ben Lomond.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another night had passed away; the sun rose
brilliantly, forming with his level beams a splendid
rainbow in the far-off west, whither the heavy
cloud, which for the last two hours had been
pouring its waters on the earth, was now flying
before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! then, and it's little good it'll be the claning
of ye,&rdquo; apostrophized Mr. Barney Maguire, as he
deposited, in front of his master's toilet, a pair of
&ldquo;bran new&rdquo; jockey boots, one of Hoby's primest
fits, which the lieutenant had purchased in his way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
through town. On that very morning had they
come for the first time under the valet's depurating
hand, so little soiled, indeed, from the turfy ride
of the preceding day, that a less scrupulous domestic
might, perhaps, have considered the application
of &ldquo;Warren's Matchless,&rdquo; or oxalic acid, altogether
superfluous. Not so Barney: with the
nicest care had he removed the slightest impurity
from each polished surface, and there they stood,
rejoicing in their sable radiance. No wonder a
pang shot across Mr. Maguire's breast as he
thought on the work now cut out for them, so
different from the light labors of the day before;
no wonder he murmured with a sigh, as the scarce
dried window-panes disclosed a road now inch deep
in mud! &ldquo;Ah! then, it's little good claning of ye!&rdquo;&mdash;for
well had he learned in the hall below that
eight miles of a stiff clay soil lay between the manor
and Bolsover Abbey, whose picturesque ruins,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Like ancient Rome, majestic in decay,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the party had determined to explore. The master
had already commenced dressing, and the man was
fitting straps upon a light pair of crane-necked
spurs, when his hand was arrested by the old
question&mdash;&ldquo;Barney, where are the breeches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were nowhere to be found!</p>

<p>Mr. Seaforth descended that morning, whip in
hand, and equipped in a handsome green riding-frock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
but no &ldquo;breeches and boots to match&rdquo; were
there: loose jean trousers, surmounting a pair of
diminutive Wellingtons, embraced, somewhat incongruously,
his nether man, <i>vice</i> the &ldquo;patent cords,&rdquo;
returned, like yesterday's pantaloons, absent without
leave. The &ldquo;top-boots&rdquo; had a holiday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fine morning after the rain,&rdquo; said Mr.
Simpkinson from Bath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the thing for the 'ops,&rdquo; said Mr. Peters.
&ldquo;I remember when I was a boy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do hold your tongue, P.,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peters&mdash;advice
which that exemplary matron was in the
constant habit of administering to &ldquo;her P.&rdquo; as she
called him, whenever he prepared to vent his
reminiscences. Her precise reason for this it
would be difficult to determine, unless, indeed, the
story be true which a little bird had whispered
into Mrs. Botherby's ear&mdash;Mr. Peters, though now
a wealthy man had received a liberal education
at a charity school, and was apt to recur to the
days of his muffin-cap and leathers. As usual,
he took his wife's hint in good part, and &ldquo;paused
in his reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A glorious day for the ruins!&rdquo; said young
Ingoldsby. &ldquo;But Charles, what the deuce are
you about? you don't mean to ride through our
lanes in such toggery as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lassy me!&rdquo; said Miss Julia Simpkinson,
&ldquo;won't yo' be very wet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better take Tom's cab,&rdquo; quoth the
squire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>But this proposition was at once over-ruled;
Mrs. Ogleton had already nailed the cab, a vehicle
of all others the best adapted for a snug flirtation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or drive Miss Julia in the phaeton?&rdquo; No;
that was the post of Mr. Peters, who, indifferent
as an equestrian, had acquired some fame as a
whip while traveling through the midland counties
for the firm of Bagshaw, Snivelby, and Ghrimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I shall ride with my cousins,&rdquo;
said Charles, with as much <i>nonchalance</i> as he could
assume&mdash;and he did so; Mr. Ingoldsby, Mrs.
Peters, Mr. Simpkinson from Bath, and his eldest
daughter with her <i>album</i>, following in the family
coach. The gentleman-commoner &ldquo;voted the
affair d&mdash;&mdash;d slow,&rdquo; and declined the party altogether
in favor of the gamekeeper and a cigar.
&ldquo;There was 'no fun' in looking at old houses!&rdquo;
Mrs. Simpkinson preferred a short <i>s&eacute;jour</i> in the
still-room with Mrs. Botherby, who had promised
to initiate her in that grand <i>arcanum</i>, the transmutation
of gooseberry jam into Guava jelly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see an old abbey before, Mrs.
Peters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss, a French one; we have got one at
Ramsgate; he teaches the Miss Joneses to parley-voo
and is turned of sixty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Simpkinson closed her album with an air
of ineffable disdain.</p>

<p>Mr. Simpkinson from Bath was a professed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
antiquary, and one of the first water; he was
master of Gwillim's Heraldry, and Mill's History
of the Crusades; knew every plate in the Monasticon;
had written an essay on the origin and dignity
of the office of overseer, and settled the date on
a Queen Anne's farthing. An influential member
of the Antiquarian Society, to whose &ldquo;Beauties of
Bagnigge Wells&rdquo; he had been a liberal subscriber,
procured him a seat at the board of that learned
body, since which happy epoch Sylvanus Urban
had not a more indefatigable correspondent. His
inaugural essay on the President's cocked hat was
considered a miracle of erudition; and his account
of the earliest application of gilding to gingerbread,
a masterpiece of antiquarian research. His eldest
daughter was of a kindred spirit: if her father's
mantle had not fallen upon her, it was only because
he had not thrown it off himself; she had caught
hold of its tail, however, while it yet hung upon
his honored shoulders. To souls so congenial,
what a sight was the magnificent ruin of Bolsover!
its broken arches, its mouldering pinnacles, and
the airy tracery of its half-demolished windows.
The party were in raptures; Mr. Simpkinson began
to meditate an essay, and his daughter an
ode: even Seaforth, as he gazed on these lonely
relics of the olden time, was betrayed into a
momentary forgetfulness of his love and losses;
the widow's eye-glass turned from her <i>cicisbeo's</i>
whiskers to the mantling ivy; Mrs. Peters wiped
her spectacles; and &ldquo;her P.&rdquo; supposed the central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
tower &ldquo;had once been the county jail.&rdquo; The squire
was a philosopher, and had been there often before,
so he ordered out the cold tongue and chickens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bolsover Priory,&rdquo; said Mr. Simpkinson, with
the air of a connoisseur&mdash;&ldquo;Bolsover Priory was
founded in the reign of Henry the Sixth, about the
beginning of the eleventh century. Hugh de
Bolsover had accompanied that monarch to the
Holy Land, in the expedition undertaken by way
of penance for the murder of his young nephews
in the Tower. Upon the dissolution of the monasteries,
the veteran was enfeoffed in the lands
and manor, to which he gave his own name of
Bowlsover, or Bee-owls-over (by corruption Bolsover)&mdash;a
Bee in chief, over three Owls, all proper,
being the armorial ensigns borne by this distinguished
crusader at the siege of Acre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that was Sir Sidney Smith,&rdquo; said Mr.
Peters; &ldquo;I've heard tell of him, and all about Mrs.
Partington, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P. be quiet, and don't expose yourself!&rdquo;
sharply interrupted his lady. P. was silenced,
and betook himself to the bottled stout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These lands,&rdquo; continued the antiquary, &ldquo;were
held in grand serjeantry by the presentation of
three white owls and pot of honey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lassy me! how nice!&rdquo; said Miss Julia. Mr.
Peters licked his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray give me leave, my dear&mdash;owls and honey,
whenever the king should come a rat-catching into
this part of the country.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rat-catching!&rdquo; ejaculated the squire, pausing
abruptly in the mastication of a drumstick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, my dear sir; don't you remember
the rats came under the forest laws&mdash;a minor
species of venison? 'Rats and mice, and such
small deer,' eh?&mdash;Shakespeare, you know. Our
ancestors ate rats ('The nasty fellows!' shuddered
Miss Julia, in a parenthesis); and owls, you know,
are capital mousers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've seen a howl,&rdquo; said Mr. Peters; &ldquo;there's
one in the Sohological Gardens&mdash;a little hook-nosed
chap in a wig&mdash;only its feathers and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor P. was destined never to finish a speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> be quiet!&rdquo; cried the authoritative voice;
and the would-be naturalist shrank into his shell,
like a snail in the &ldquo;Sohological Gardens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should read Blount's <i>Jocular Tenures</i>,
Mr. Ingoldsby,&rdquo; pursued Simpkinson. &ldquo;A learned
man was Blount! Why, sir, His Royal Highness
the Duke of York once paid a silver horse-shoe to
Lord Ferrers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've heard of him,&rdquo; broke in the incorrigible
Peters; &ldquo;he was hanged at the Old Bailey in a
silk rope for shooting Dr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The antiquary vouchsafed no notice of the interruption;
but, taking a pinch of snuff, continued
his harangue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A silver horse-shoe, sir, which is due from every
scion of royalty who rides across one of his manors;
and if you look into the penny county histories,
now publishing by an eminent friend of mine, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
will find that Langhale in Co. Norf. was held by
one Baldwin <i>per saltum, sufflatum, et pettum</i>; that
is, he was to come every Christmas into Westminster
Hall, there to take a leap, cry hem! and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Simpkinson, a glass of sherry?&rdquo; cried Tom
Ingoldsby, hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any, thank you, sir. This Baldwin,
surnamed <i>Le&mdash;&mdash;</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ogleton challenges you, sir; she insists
upon it,&rdquo; said Tom still more rapidly, at the same
time filling a glass, and forcing it on the <i>s&ccedil;avant</i>,
who, thus arrested in the very crisis of his narrative,
received and swallowed the potation as if it
had been physic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth has Miss Simpkinson discovered
there?&rdquo; continued Tom; &ldquo;something of interest.
See how fast she is writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The diversion was effectual; every one looked
towards Miss Simpkinson, who, far too ethereal
for &ldquo;creature comforts,&rdquo; was seated apart on the
dilapidated remains of an altar-tomb, committing
eagerly to paper something that had strongly
impressed her; the air&mdash;the eye in a &ldquo;fine frenzy
rolling&rdquo;&mdash;all betokened that the divine <i>afflarus</i>
was come. Her father rose, and stole silently
towards her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an old boar!&rdquo; muttered young Ingoldsby;
alluding, perhaps, to a slice of brawn which
he had just begun to operate upon, but which,
from the celerity with which it disappeared, did
not seem so very difficult of mastication.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>But what had become of Seaforth and his fair
Caroline all this while? Why, it so happened that
they had been simultaneously stricken with the
picturesque appearance of one of those high and
pointed arches, which that eminent antiquary,
Mr. Horseley Curties, has described in his <i>Ancient
Records</i>, as &ldquo;a <i>Gothic</i> window of the <i>Saxon</i> order&rdquo;;
and then the ivy clustered so thickly and so beautifully
on the other side, that they went round to
look at that; and then their proximity deprived
it of half its effect, and so they walked across to a
little knoll, a hundred yards off, and in crossing a
small ravine, they came to what in Ireland they
call &ldquo;a bad step,&rdquo; and Charles had to carry his
cousin over it; and then when they had to come
back, she would not give him the trouble again for
the world, so they followed a better but more
circuitous route, and there were hedges and ditches
in the way, and stiles to get over and gates to
get through, so that an hour or more had elapsed
before they were able to rejoin the party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lassy me!&rdquo; said Miss Julia Simpkinson, &ldquo;how
long you have been gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so they had. The remark was a very just
as well as a very natural one. They were gone a
long while, and a nice cosy chat they had; and
what do you think it was all about, my dear miss?</p>

<p>&ldquo;O lassy me! love, no doubt, and the moon, and
eyes, and nightingales, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stay, stay, my sweet young lady; do not let the
fervor of your feelings run away with you! I do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
not pretend to say, indeed, that one or more of
these pretty subjects might not have been introduced;
but the most important and leading topic
of the conference was&mdash;Lieutenant Seaforth's
breeches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caroline,&rdquo; said Charles, &ldquo;I have had some
very odd dreams since I have been at Tappington.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreams, have you?&rdquo; smiled the young lady,
arching her taper neck like a swan in pluming.
&ldquo;Dreams, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dreams&mdash;or dream, perhaps, I should say;
for, though repeated, it was still the same. And
what do you imagine was its subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to divine,&rdquo; said the
tongue; &ldquo;I have not the least difficulty in guessing,&rdquo;
said the eye, as plainly as ever eye spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamt&mdash;of your great-grandfather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a change in the glance&mdash;&ldquo;My great-grandfather?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the old Sir Giles, or Sir John, you told
me about the other day: he walked into my bedroom
in his short cloak of murrey-colored velvet,
his long rapier, and his Raleigh-looking hat and
feather, just as the picture represents him; but
with one exception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, his lower extremities, which were visible,
were those of a skeleton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after taking a turn or two about the
room, and looking round him with a wistful air, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
came to the bed's foot, stared at me in a manner
impossible to describe&mdash;and then he&mdash;he laid hold
of my pantaloons; whipped his long bony legs into
them in a twinkling; and strutting up to the glass,
seemed to view himself in it with great complacency.
I tried to speak, but in vain. The
effort, however, seemed to excite his attention;
for, wheeling about, he showed me the grimmest-looking
death's head you can well imagine, and
with an indescribable grin strutted out of the
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absurd! Charles. How can you talk such
nonsense?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Caroline&mdash;the breeches are really gone.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the following morning, contrary to his usual
custom, Seaforth was the first person in the breakfast
parlor. As no one else was present, he did
precisely what nine young men out of ten so situated
would have done; he walked up to the mantelpiece,
established himself upon the rug, and
subducting his coat-tails one under each arm,
turned towards the fire that portion of the human
frame which it is considered equally indecorous
to present to a friend or an enemy. A serious,
not to say anxious, expression was visible upon
his good-humored countenance, and his mouth
was fast buttoning itself up for an incipient
whistle, when little Flo, a tiny spaniel of the Blenheim
breed&mdash;the pet object of Miss Julia Simpkinson's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
affections&mdash;bounced out from beneath a sofa,
and began to bark at&mdash;his pantaloons.</p>

<p>They were cleverly &ldquo;built,&rdquo; of a light-grey
mixture, a broad stripe of the most vivid scarlet
traversing each seam in a perpendicular direction
from hip to ankle&mdash;in short, the regimental
costume of the Royal Bombay Fencibles. The
animal, educated in the country, had never seen
such a pair of breeches in her life&mdash;<i>Omne ignotum
pro magnifico!</i> The scarlet streak, inflamed as it
was by the reflection of the fire, seemed to act
on Flora's nerves as the same color does on those
of bulls and turkeys; she advanced at the <i>pas de
charge</i>, and her vociferation, like her amazement,
was unbounded. A sound kick from the disgusted
officer changed its character, and induced a retreat
at the very moment when the mistress of the
pugnacious quadruped entered to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lassy me! Flo, what <i>is</i> the matter?&rdquo; cried
the sympathizing lady, with a scrutinizing glance
leveled at the gentleman.</p>

<p>It might as well have lighted on a feather bed.
His air of imperturbable unconsciousness defied
examination; and as he would not, and Flora
could not, expound, that injured individual was
compelled to pocket up her wrongs. Others of
the household soon dropped in, and clustered
round the board dedicated to the most sociable of
meals; the urn was paraded &ldquo;hissing hot,&rdquo; and
the cups which &ldquo;cheer, but not inebriate,&rdquo; steamed
redolent of hyson and pekoe; muffins and marmalade,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
newspapers, and Finnan haddies, left little
room for observation on the character of Charles's
warlike &ldquo;turn-out.&rdquo; At length a look from Caroline,
followed by a smile that nearly ripened to a
titter, caused him to turn abruptly and address
his neighbor. It was Miss Simpkinson, who,
deeply engaged in sipping her tea and turning over
her album, seemed, like a female Chrononotonthologos,
&ldquo;immersed in cogibundity of cogitation.&rdquo;
An interrogatory on the subject of her studies
drew from her the confession that she was at that
moment employed in putting the finishing touches
to a poem inspired by the romantic shades of
Bolsover. The entreaties of the company were
of course urgent. Mr. Peters, &ldquo;who liked verses,&rdquo;
was especially persevering, and Sappho at length
compliant. After a preparatory hem! and a
glance at the mirror to ascertain that her look was
sufficiently sentimental, the poetess began:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There is a calm, a holy feeling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vulgar minds, can never know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the bosom softly stealing,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Chasten'd grief, delicious woe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how sweet at eve regaining<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yon lone tower's sequester'd shade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly mute and uncomplaining&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Yow!&mdash;yeough!&mdash;yeough!&mdash;yow!&mdash;yow!&rdquo; yelled
a hapless sufferer from beneath the table. It was
an unlucky hour for quadrupeds; and if &ldquo;every
dog will have his day,&rdquo; he could not have selected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
a more unpropitious one than this. Mrs. Ogleton,
too, had a pet&mdash;a favorite pug&mdash;whose squab
figure, black muzzle, and tortuosity of tail, that
curled like a head of celery in a salad-bowl, bespoke
his Dutch extraction. Yow! yow! yow!
continued the brute&mdash;a chorus in which Flo instantly
joined. Sooth to say, pug had more reason
to express his dissatisfaction than was given him
by the muse of Simpkinson; the other only barked
for company. Scarcely had the poetess got
through her first stanza, when Tom Ingoldsby,
in the enthusiasm of the moment, became so lost
in the material world, that, in his abstraction, he
unwarily laid his hand on the cock of the urn.
Quivering with emotion, he gave it such an unlucky
twist, that the full stream of its scalding contents
descended on the gingerbread hide of the unlucky
Cupid. The confusion was complete; the whole
economy of the table disarranged&mdash;the company
broke up in most admired disorder&mdash;and &ldquo;vulgar
minds will never know&rdquo; anything more of Miss
Simpkinson's ode till they peruse it in some
forthcoming Annual.</p>

<p>Seaforth profited by the confusion to take the
delinquent who had caused this &ldquo;stramash&rdquo; by
the arm, and to lead him to the lawn, where he had
a word or two for his private ear. The conference
between the young gentlemen was neither brief
in its duration nor unimportant in its result. The
subject was what the lawyers call tripartite, embracing
the information that Charles Seaforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
was over head and ears in love with Tom Ingoldsby's
sister; secondly, that the lady had referred
him to &ldquo;papa&rdquo; for his sanction; thirdly, and
lastly, his nightly visitations and consequent
bereavement. At the two first times Tom smiled
suspiciously&mdash;at the last he burst out into an
absolute &ldquo;guffaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steal your breeches! Miss Bailey over again,
by Jove,&rdquo; shouted Ingoldsby. &ldquo;But a gentleman,
you say&mdash;and Sir Giles, too. I am not sure,
Charles, whether I ought not to call you out for
aspersing the honor of the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laugh as you will, Tom&mdash;be as incredulous
as you please. One fact is incontestable&mdash;the
breeches are gone! Look here&mdash;I am reduced to
my regimentals; and if these go, to-morrow I must
borrow of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rochefoucault says, there is something in the
misfortunes of our very best friends that does not
displease us; assuredly we can, most of us, laugh
at their petty inconveniences, till called upon to
supply them. Tom composed his features on the
instant, and replied with more gravity, as well as
with an expletive, which, if my Lord Mayor had
been within hearing might have cost him five
shillings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something very queer in this, after
all. The clothes, you say, have positively disappeared.
Somebody is playing you a trick; and,
ten to one, your servant had a hand in it. By the
way, I heard something yesterday of his kicking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
up a bobbery in the kitchen, and seeing a ghost, or
something of that kind, himself. Depend upon
it, Barney is in the plot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It now struck the lieutenant at once, that the
usually buoyant spirits of his attendant had of late
been materially sobered down, his loquacity obviously
circumscribed, and that he, the said
lieutenant, had actually rung his bell three several
times that very morning before he could procure
his attendance. Mr. Maguire was forthwith
summoned, and underwent a close examination.
The &ldquo;bobbery&rdquo; was easily explained. Mr. Oliver
Dobbs had hinted his disapprobation of a flirtation
carrying on between the gentleman from
Munster and the lady from the Rue St. Honor&eacute;.
Mademoiselle had boxed Mr. Maguire's ears, and
Mr. Maguire had pulled Mademoiselle upon his
knee, and the lady had <i>not</i> cried <i>Mon Dieu!</i> And
Mr. Oliver Dobbs said it was very wrong; and Mrs.
Botherby said it was &ldquo;scandalous,&rdquo; and what
ought not to be done in any moral kitchen; and
Mr. Maguire had got hold of the Honorable
Augustus Sucklethumbkin's powder-flask, and had
put large pinches of the best Double Dartford
into Mr. Dobbs's tobacco-box; and Mr. Dobbs's
pipe had exploded, and set fire to Mrs. Botherby's
Sunday cap; and Mr. Maguire had put it out with
the slop-basin, &ldquo;barring the wig&rdquo;; and then they
were all so &ldquo;cantankerous,&rdquo; that Barney had gone
to take a walk in the garden; and then&mdash;then Mr.
Barney had seen a ghost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A what? you blockhead!&rdquo; asked Tom
Ingoldsby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure then, and it's meself will tell your honor
the rights of it,&rdquo; said the ghost-seer. &ldquo;Meself
and Miss Pauline, sir&mdash;or Miss Pauline and meself,
for the ladies comes first anyhow&mdash;we got
tired of the hobstroppylous scrimmaging among
the ould servants, that didn't know a joke when
they seen one: and we went out to look at the
comet&mdash;that's the rorybory-alehouse, they calls
him in this country&mdash;and we walked upon the
lawn&mdash;and divil of any alehouse there was there
at all; and Miss Pauline said it was bekase of the
shrubbery maybe, and why wouldn't we see it
better beyonst the tree? and so we went to the
trees, but sorrow a comet did meself see there,
barring a big ghost instead of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ghost? And what sort of a ghost, Barney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och, then, divil a lie I'll tell your honor. A
tall ould gentleman he was, all in white, with a
shovel on the shoulder of him, and a big torch in
his fist&mdash;though what he wanted with that it's
meself can't tell, for his eyes were like gig-lamps, let
alone the moon and the comet, which wasn't there
at all&mdash;and 'Barney,' says he to me&mdash;'cause why
he knew me&mdash;'Barney,' says he, 'what is it you're
doing with the <i>colleen</i> there, Barney?'&mdash;Divil a
word did I say. Miss Pauline screeched, and
cried murther in French, and ran off with herself;
and of course meself was in a mighty hurry after
the lady, and had no time to stop palavering with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
him any way: so I dispersed at once, and the ghost
vanished in a flame of fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Maguire's account was received with
avowed incredulity by both gentlemen; but Barney
stuck to his text with unflinching pertinacity. A
reference to Mademoiselle was suggested, but
abandoned, as neither party had a taste for delicate
investigations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you what, Seaforth,&rdquo; said Ingoldsby,
after Barney had received his dismissal, &ldquo;that
there is a trick here, is evident; and Barney's
vision may possibly be a part of it. Whether he is
most knave or fool, you best know. At all events,
I will sit up with you to-night, and see if I can
convert my ancestor into a visiting acquaintance.
Meanwhile your finger on your lip!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gladly would I grace my tale with decent horror,
and therefore I do beseech the &ldquo;gentle reader&rdquo; to
believe, that if all the <i>succedanea</i> to this mysterious
narrative are not in strict keeping, he will

modern degeneracy upon the sober and dignified
habits of our ancestors. I can introduce him, it
is true, into an old and high-roofed chamber, its
walls covered in three sides with black oak wainscoting,
adorned with carvings of fruit and flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
long anterior to those of Grinling Gibbons; the
fourth side is clothed with a curious remnant of
dingy tapestry, once elucidatory of some Scriptural
history, but of <i>which</i> not even Mrs. Botherby
could determine. Mr. Simpkinson, who had
examined it carefully, inclined to believe the
principal figure to be either Bathsheba, or Daniel
in the lions' den; while Tom Ingoldsby decided in
favor of the king of Bashan. All, however, was
conjecture, tradition being silent on the subject.
A lofty arched portal led into, and a little arched
portal led out of, this apartment; they were opposite
each other, and each possessed the security
of massy bolts on its interior. The bedstead, too,
was not one of yesterday, but manifestly coeval
with days ere Seddons was, and when a good four-post
&ldquo;article&rdquo; was deemed worthy of being a
royal bequest. The bed itself, with all the appurtenances
of palliasse, mattresses, etc., was of far
later date, and looked most incongruously comfortable;
the casements, too, with their little diamond-shaped
panes and iron binding, had given way to
the modern heterodoxy of the sash-window. Nor
was this all that conspired to ruin the costume, and
render the room a meet haunt for such &ldquo;mixed
spirits&rdquo; only as could condescend to don at the
same time an Elizabethan doublet and Bond Street
inexpressibles.</p>

<p>With their green morocco slippers on a modern
fender, in front of a disgracefully modern grate,
sat two young gentlemen, clad in &ldquo;shawl pattern&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
dressing-gowns and black silk stocks, much at
variance with the high cane-backed chairs which
supported them. A bunch of abomination, called
a cigar, reeked in the left-hand corner of the mouth
of one, and in the right-hand corner of the mouth of
the other&mdash;an arrangement happily adapted for
the escape of the noxious fumes up the chimney,
without that unmerciful &ldquo;funking&rdquo; each other,
which a less scientific disposition of the weed
would have induced. A small pembroke table
filled up the intervening space between them, sustaining,
at each extremity, an elbow and a glass
of toddy&mdash;thus in &ldquo;lonely pensive contemplation&rdquo;
were the two worthies occupied, when the &ldquo;iron
tongue of midnight had tolled twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghost-time's come!&rdquo; said Ingoldsby, taking
from his waistcoat pocket a watch like a gold
half-crown, and consulting it as though he suspected
the turret-clock over the stables of
mendacity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Charles; &ldquo;did I not hear a footstep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause&mdash;there <i>was</i> a footstep&mdash;it
sounded distinctly&mdash;it reached the door it hesitated,
stopped, and&mdash;passed on.</p>

<p>Tom darted across the room, threw open the
door, and became aware of Mrs. Botherby toddling
to her chamber, at the other end of the gallery,
after dosing one of the housemaids with an approved
julep from the Countess of Kent's &ldquo;Choice
Manual.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, sir!&rdquo; said Mrs. Botherby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the d&mdash;&mdash;l!&rdquo; said the disappointed ghost-hunter.</p>

<p>An hour&mdash;two&mdash;rolled on, and still no spectral
visitation; nor did aught intervene to make night
hideous; and when the turret-clock sounded at
length the hour of three, Ingoldsby, whose patience
and grog were alike exhausted, sprang from his
chair, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is all infernal nonsense, my good fellow.
Deuce of any ghost shall we see to-night; it's long
past the canonical hour. I'm off to bed; and as
to your breeches, I'll insure them for the next
twenty-four hours at least, at the price of the
buckram.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&mdash;Oh! thank'ee&mdash;to be sure!&rdquo; stammered
Charles, rousing himself from a reverie,
which had degenerated into an absolute snooze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my boy! Bolt the door behind
me; and defy the Pope, the Devil, and the
Pretender!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seaforth followed his friend's advice, and the
next morning came down to breakfast dressed in
the habiliments of the preceding day. The charm
was broken, the demon defeated; the light greys
with the red stripe down the seams were yet <i>in
rerum natur&acirc;</i>, and adorned the person of their
lawful proprietor.</p>

<p>Tom felicitated himself and his partner of the
watch on the result of their vigilance; but there is
a rustic adage, which warns us against self-gratulation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
before we are quite &ldquo;out of the wood.&rdquo;&mdash;Seaforth
was yet within its verge.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A rap at Tom Ingoldsby's door the following
morning startled him as he was shaving&mdash;he cut
his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you!&rdquo; said the martyr,
pressing his thumb on the scarified epidermis. The
door opened, and exhibited Mr. Barney Maguire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Barney, what is it?&rdquo; quoth the sufferer,
adopting the vernacular of his visitant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The master, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what does he want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The loanst of a breeches, plase your honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you don't mean to tell me&mdash;By
Heaven, this is too good!&rdquo; shouted Tom, bursting
into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. &ldquo;Why,
Barney, you don't mean to say the ghost has got
them again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Maguire did not respond to the young
squire's risibility; the cast of his countenance was
decidedly serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith, then, it's gone they are sure enough!
Hasn't meself been looking over the bed, and
under the bed, and <i>in</i> the bed, for the matter of
that, and divil a ha'p'orth of breeches is there
to the fore at all:&mdash;I'm bothered entirely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark'ee! Mr. Barney,&rdquo; said Tom, incautiously
removing his thumb, and letting a crimson
stream &ldquo;incarnadine the multitudinous&rdquo; lather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
that plastered his throat&mdash;&ldquo;this may be all very
well with your master, but you don't humbug <i>me</i>,
sir:&mdash;Tell me instantly what have you done with
the clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This abrupt transition from &ldquo;lively to severe&rdquo;
certainly took Maguire by surprise, and he seemed
for an instant as much disconcerted as it is possible
to disconcert an Irish gentleman's gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? is it meself, then, that's the ghost to your
honor's thinking?&rdquo; said he after a moment's pause,
and with a slight shade of indignation in his tones;
&ldquo;is it I would stale the master's things&mdash;and what
would I do with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you best know: what your purpose is I
can't guess, for I don't think you mean to 'stale'
them, as you call it; but that you are concerned
in their disappearance, I am satisfied. Confound
this blood!&mdash;give me a towel, Barney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maguire acquitted himself of the commission.
&ldquo;As I've a sowl, your honor,&rdquo; said he, solemnly,
&ldquo;little it is meself knows of the matter: and after
what I seen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you've seen! Why, what <i>have</i> you seen?&mdash;Barney,
I don't want to inquire into your flirtations;
but don't suppose you can palm off your
saucer eyes and gig-lamps upon me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, as sure as your honor's standing there,
I saw him: and why wouldn't I, when Miss <i>Pauline</i>
was to the fore as well as meself, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get along with your nonsense&mdash;leave the room,
sir!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the master?&rdquo; said Barney, imploringly;
&ldquo;and without a breeches?&mdash;sure he'll be catching
cowld&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that, rascal!&rdquo; replied Ingoldsby, throwing
a pair of pantaloons at, rather than to, him:
&ldquo;but don't suppose, sir, you shall carry on your
tricks here with impunity; recollect there is such
a thing as a treadmill, and that my father is a
county magistrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney's eye flashed fire&mdash;he stood erect, and
was about to speak; but, mastering himself, not
without an effort, he took up the garment, and left
the room as perpendicular as a Quaker.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&ldquo;Ingoldsby,&rdquo; said Charles Seaforth, after breakfast,
&ldquo;this is now past a joke; to-day is the last of
my stay; for, notwithstanding the ties which detain
me, common decency obliges me to visit home
after so long an absence. I shall come to an immediate
explanation with your father on the subject
nearest my heart, and depart while I have a
change of dress left. On his answer will my return
depend! In the meantime tell me candidly&mdash;I
ask it in all seriousness, and as a friend&mdash;am I
not a dupe to your well-known propensity to
hoaxing? have you not a hand in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, by heaven, Seaforth; I see what you mean:
on my honor, I am as much mystified as yourself;
and if your servant&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he:&mdash;If there be a trick, he at least is not
privy to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there <i>be</i> a trick? why, Charles, do you,
think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not <i>what</i> to think, Tom. As surely as
you are a living man, so surely did that spectral
anatomy visit my room again last night, grin in
my face, and walk away with my trousers; nor was
I able to spring from my bed, or break the chain
which seemed to bind me to my pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seaforth!&rdquo; said Ingoldsby, after a short pause,
&ldquo;I will&mdash;But hush! here are the girls and my
father. I will carry off the females, and leave you
a clear field with the governor: carry your point
with him, and we will talk about your breeches
afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom's diversion was successful; he carried off
the ladies <i>en masse</i> to look at a remarkable specimen
of the class <i>Dodecandria Monogynia</i>&mdash;which
they could not find&mdash;while Seaforth marched
boldly up to the encounter, and carried &ldquo;the
governor's&rdquo; outworks by a <i>coup de main</i>. I shall
not stop to describe the progress of the attack;
suffice it that it was as successful as could have
been wished, and that Seaforth was referred back
again to the lady. The happy lover was off at a
tangent; the botanical party was soon overtaken;
and the arm of Caroline, whom a vain endeavor to
spell out the Linn&aelig;an name of a daffy-down-dilly
had detained a little in the rear of the others, was
soon firmly locked in his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">What was the world to them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its noise, its nonsense and its &ldquo;breeches&rdquo; all?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Seaforth was in the seventh heaven; he retired to
his room that night as happy as if no such thing as
a goblin had ever been heard of, and personal
chattels were as well fenced in by law as real
property. Not so Tom Ingoldsby: the mystery&mdash;for
mystery there evidently was&mdash;had not only
piqued his curiosity, but ruffled his temper. The
watch of the previous night had been unsuccessful,
probably because it was undisguised. To-night
he would &ldquo;ensconce himself&rdquo;&mdash;not indeed &ldquo;behind
the arras&rdquo;&mdash;for the little that remained was,
as we have seen, nailed to the wall&mdash;but in a small
closet which opened from one corner of the room,
and by leaving the door ajar, would give to its
occupant a view of all that might pass in the apartment.
Here did the young ghost-hunter take up
a position, with a good stout sapling under his arm,
a full half-hour before Seaforth retired for the
night. Not even his friend did he let into his confidence,
fully determined that if his plan did not
succeed, the failure should be attributed to himself
alone.</p>

<p>At the usual hour of separation for the night,
Tom saw, from his concealment, the lieutenant
enter his room, and after taking a few turns in it,
with an expression so joyous as to betoken that
his thoughts were mainly occupied by his approaching
happiness, proceed slowly to disrobe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
himself. The coat, the waistcoat, the black silk
stock, were gradually discarded; the green morocco
slippers were kicked off, and then&mdash;ay, and then&mdash;his
countenance grew grave; it seemed to occur to
him all at once that this was his last stake&mdash;nay,
that the very breeches he had on were not his own&mdash;that
to-morrow morning was his last, and that
if he lost <i>them</i>&mdash;A glance showed that his mind
was made up; he replaced the single button he
had just subducted, and threw himself upon the
bed in a state of transition&mdash;half chrysalis, half
grub.</p>

<p>Wearily did Tom Ingoldsby watch the sleeper
by the flickering light of the night-lamp, till the
clock striking one, induced him to increase the
narrow opening which he had left for the purpose
of observation. The motion, slight as it was,
seemed to attract Charles's attention; for he
raised himself suddenly to a sitting posture,
listened for a moment, and then stood upright upon
the floor. Ingoldsby was on the point of discovering
himself, when, the light flashing full upon his
friend's countenance, he perceived that, though
his eyes were open, &ldquo;their sense was shut&rdquo;&mdash;that
he was yet under the influence of sleep. Seaforth
advanced slowly to the toilet, lit his candle at the
lamp that stood on it, then, going back to the bed's
foot, appeared to search eagerly for something
which he could not find. For a few moments he
seemed restless and uneasy, walking round the
apartment and examining the chairs, till, coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
fully in front of a large swing-glass that flanked
the dressing-table, he paused as if contemplating
his figure in it. He now returned towards the
bed; put on his slippers, and, with cautious and
stealthy steps, proceeded towards the little arched
doorway that opened on the private staircase.</p>

<p>As he drew the bolt, Tom Ingoldsby emerged
from his hiding-place; but the sleep-walker heard
him not; he proceeded softly downstairs, followed
at a due distance by his friend; opened the door
which led out upon the gardens; and stood at once
among the thickest of the shrubs, which there
clustered round the base of a corner turret, and
screened the postern from common observation.
At this moment Ingoldsby had nearly spoiled all
by making a false step: the sound attracted Seaforth's
attention&mdash;he paused and turned; and, as
the full moon shed her light directly upon his pale
and troubled features, Tom marked, almost with
dismay, the fixed and rayless appearance of his
eyes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was no speculation in those orbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he did glare withal.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The perfect stillness preserved by his follower
seemed to reassure him; he turned aside, and from
the midst of a thickest laurustinus drew forth a
gardener's spade, shouldering which he proceeded
with great rapidity into the midst of the shrubbery.
Arrived at a certain point where the earth
seemed to have been recently disturbed, he set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
himself heartily to the task of digging, till, having
thrown up several shovelfuls of mould, he stopped,
flung down his tool, and very composedly began
to disencumber himself of his pantaloons.</p>

<p>Up to this moment Tom had watched him with
a wary eye; he now advanced cautiously, and, as
his friend was busily engaged in disentangling
himself from his garment, made himself master
of the spade. Seaforth, meanwhile, had accomplished
his purpose: he stood for a moment with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His streamers waving in the wind,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>occupied in carefully rolling up the small-clothes
into as compact a form as possible, and all heedless
of the breath of heaven, which might certainly be
supposed at such a moment, and in such a plight,
to &ldquo;visit his frame too roughly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was in the act of stooping low to deposit the
pantaloons in the grave which he had been digging
for them, when Tom Ingoldsby came close behind
him, and with the flat side of the spade&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The shock was effectual; never again was
Lieutenant Seaforth known to act the part of a
somnambulist. One by one, his breeches&mdash;his
trousers&mdash;his pantaloons&mdash;his silk-net tights&mdash;his
patent cords&mdash;his showy greys with the broad
red stripe of the Bombay Fencibles were brought
to light&mdash;rescued from the grave in which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
had been buried, like the strata of a Christmas
pie; and after having been well aired by Mrs.
Botherby, became once again effective.</p>

<p>The family, the ladies especially, laughed;
the Peterses laughed; the Simpkinsons laughed;&mdash;Barney
Maguire cried &ldquo;Botheration!&rdquo; and
<i>Ma'mselle Pauline</i>, &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charles Seaforth, unable to face the quizzing
which awaited him on all sides, started off two
hours earlier than he had proposed:&mdash;he soon
returned, however; and having, at his father-in-law's
request, given up the occupation of Rajah-hunting
and shooting Nabobs, led his blushing
bride to the altar.</p>

<p>Mr. Simpkinson from Bath did not attend the
ceremony, being engaged at the Grand Junction
meeting of <i>S&ccedil;avans</i>, then, congregating from all
parts of the known world in the city of Dublin.
His essay, demonstrating that the globe is a great
custard, whipped into coagulation by whirlwinds
and cooked by electricity&mdash;a little too much baked
in the Isle of Portland, and a thought underdone
about the Bog of Allen&mdash;was highly spoken of,
and narrowly escaped obtaining a Bridgewater
prize.</p>

<p>Miss Simpkinson and her sister acted as brides-maids
on the occasion; the former wrote an <i>epithalamium</i>,
and the latter cried &ldquo;Lassy me!&rdquo; at
the clergyman's wig. Some years have since
rolled on; the union has been crowned with two or
three tidy little off-shoots from the family tree, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
whom Master Neddy is &ldquo;grandpapa's darling,&rdquo;
and Mary Anne mamma's particular &ldquo;Sock.&rdquo; I
shall only add, that Mr. and Mrs. Seaforth are
living together quite as happily as two good-hearted,
good-tempered bodies, very fond of each
other, can possibly do; and that, since the day of
his marriage, Charles has shown no disposition to
jump out of bed, or ramble out of doors o' nights&mdash;though
from his entire devotion to every wish and
whim of his young wife, Tom insinuates that the
fair Caroline does still occasionally take advantage
of it so far as to &ldquo;slip on the breeches.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>In the Barn</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> BURGES JOHNSON</h4>


<p>The moment we had entered the barn, I regretted
the rash good nature which prompted me
to consent to the plans of those vivacious young
students. Miss Anstell and Miss Royce and one
or two others, often leaders in student mischief, I
suspect, were the first to enter, and they amused
themselves by hiding in the darkness and greeting
the rest of our party as we entered with sundry
shrieks and moans such as are commonly attributed
to ghosts. My wife and I brought up
the rear, carrying the two farm lanterns. She had
selected the place after an amused consideration
of the question, and I confess I hardly approved
her judgment. But she is native to this part of
the country, and she had assured us that there
were some vague traditions hanging about the
building that made it most suitable for our
purposes.</p>

<p>It was a musty old place, without even as much
tidiness as is usually found in barns, and there was
a dank smell about it, as though generations of
haymows had decayed there. There were holes
in the floor, and in the dusk of early evening it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
necessary for us to pick our way with the greatest
care. It occurred to me then, in a premonitory
sort of way, that if some young woman student
sprained her ankle in this absurd environment, I
should be most embarrassed to explain it. Apparently
it was a hay barn, whose vague dimensions
were lost in shadow. Rafters crossed its
width about twenty feet above our heads, and
here and there a few boards lay across the rafters,
furnishing foothold for anyone who might wish
to operate the ancient pulley that was doubtless
once used for lifting bales. The northern half of
the floor was covered with hay to a depth of two
or three feet. How long it had actually been
there I cannot imagine. It was extremely dusty,
and I feared a recurrence of my old enemy, hay
fever; but it was too late to offer objection on such
grounds, and my wife and I followed our chattering
guides, who disposed themselves here and there
on this ancient bed of hay, and insisted that we
should find places in the center of their circle.</p>

<p>At my suggestion, the two farm lanterns had
been left at a suitable distance, in fact, quite at
the other side of the barn, and our only light came
from the rapidly falling twilight of outdoors, which
found its way through a little window and sundry
cracks high in the eaves above the rafters.</p>

<p>There was something about the place, now that
we were settled and no longer occupied with adjustments
of comfort, that subdued our spirits, and it
was with much less hilarity that the young people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
united in demanding a story. I looked across at
my wife, whose face was faintly visible within the
circle. I thought that even in the half-light I
glimpsed the same expression of amused incredulity
which she had worn earlier in the day when I
had yielded to the importunities of a deputation
of my students for this ghost-story party on the
eve of a holiday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason,&rdquo; I thought to myself, repeating
the phrases I had used then&mdash;&ldquo;there is no
reason why I should not tell a ghost story. True,
I had never done so before, but the literary attainments
which have enabled me to perfect my recent
treatise upon the 'Disuse of the Comma' are quite
equal to impromptu experimentation in the field
of psychic phenomena.&rdquo; I was aware that the
young people themselves hardly expected serious
acquiescence, and that, too, stimulated me. I
cleared my throat in a prefatory manner, and
silence fell upon the group. A light breeze had
risen outside, and the timbers of the barn creaked
persistently. From the shadows almost directly
overhead there came a faint clanking. It was
evidently caused by the rusty pulley-wheel which
I had observed there as we entered. An iron hook
at the end of an ancient rope still depended from
it, and swung in the lightly stirring air several
feet above our heads, directly over the center of
our circle.</p>

<p>Some curious combination of influences&mdash;perhaps
the atmosphere of the place, added to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
stimulation of the faintly discernible faces around
me, and my impulse to prove my own ability in
this untried field of narration&mdash;gave me a sudden
sense of being inspired. I found myself voicing
fancies as though they were facts, and readily
including imaginary names and data which certainly
were not in any way premeditated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This barn stands on the old Creed place,&rdquo; I
began. &ldquo;Peter Creed was its last owner, but I
suppose that it has always been and always will
be known as the Turner barn. A few yards away
to the south you will find the crumbling brick-work
and gaping hollows of an old foundation, now
overgrown with weeds that almost conceal a few
charred timbers. That is all that is left of the old
Ashley Turner house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cleared my throat again, not through any
effort to gain time for my thoughts, but to feel for a
moment the satisfaction arising from the intent
attitude of my audience, particularly my wife, who
had leaned forward and was looking at me with
an expression of startled surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashley Turner must have had a pretty fine-looking
farm here thirty years or so ago,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;when he brought his wife to it. This
barn was new then. But he was a ne'er-do-well,
with nothing to be said in his favor, unless you
admit his fame as a practical joker. Strange how
the ne'er-do-well is often equipped with an extravagant
sense of humor! Turner had a considerable
retinue among the riffraff boys of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
neighborhood, who made this barn a noisy rendezvous
and followed his hints in much whimsical
mischief. But he committed most of his practical
jokes when drunk, and in his sober moments he
abused his family and let his wife struggle to
keep up the acres, assisted only by a half-competent
man of all work. Finally he took to roving.
No one knew how he got pocket-money; his wife
could not have given him any. Then someone
discovered that he was going over to Creed's now
and then, and everything was explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This concise data of mine was evidently not
holding the close attention of my youthful audience.
They annoyed me by frequent pranks and
whisperings. No one could have been more surprised
at my glibness than I myself, except perhaps
my wife, whose attitude of strained attention had
not relaxed. I resumed my story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter Creed was a good old-fashioned usurer
of the worst type. He went to church regularly
one day in the week and gouged his neighbors&mdash;any
that he could get into his clutches&mdash;on the
other six. He must have been lending Turner
drinking money, and everyone knew what the
security must be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last there came a day when the long-suffering
wife revolted. Turner had come home extra
drunk and in his most maudlin humor. Probably
he attempted some drunken prank upon his over-taxed
helpmate. Old Ike, the hired man, said
that he thought Turner had rigged up some scare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
for her in the barn and that he had never heard
anything so much like straight talking from his
mistress, either before or since, and he was working
in the woodshed at the time, with the door shut.
Shortly after that tirade Ashley Turner disappeared,
and no one saw or heard of him or thought
about him for a couple of years except when the
sight of his tired-looking wife and scrawny children
revived the recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last, on a certain autumn day, old Peter
Creed turned up here at the Turner place. I
imagine Mrs. Turner knew what was in store for
her when his rusty buggy came in sight around the
corner of the barn. At any rate, she made no
protest, and listened meekly to his curt statement
that he held an overdue mortgage, with plenty
of back interest owing, and it was time for her
to go. She went. Neither she nor anyone else
doubted Creed's rights in the matter, and, after
all, I believe it got a better home for her somewhere
in the long run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I paused here in my narration to draw breath
and readjust my leg, which had become cramped.
There was a general readjustment and shifting of
position, with some levity. It was darker now.
The rafters above us were invisible, and the faces
about me looked oddly white against the shadowy
background. After a moment or two of delay
I cleared my throat sharply and continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Creed came thus into possession of this
place, just as he had come to own a dozen others in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the county. He usually lived on one until he was
able to sell it at a good profit over his investment; so
he settled down in the Turner house, and kept old
Ike because he worked for little or nothing. But
he seemed to have a hard time finding a purchaser.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been about a year later when an
unexpected thing happened. Creed had come out
here to the barn to lock up&mdash;he always did that
himself&mdash;when he noticed something unusual
about the haymow&mdash;this haymow&mdash;which stood
then about six feet above the barn floor. He
looked closer through the dusk, and saw a pair of
boots; went nearer, and found that they were
fitted to a pair of human legs whose owner was
sound asleep in his hay. Creed picked up a short
stick and beat on one boot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Get out of here,' he said, 'or I'll have you
locked up.' The sleeper woke in slow fashion,
sat up, grinned, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Hello, Peter Creed.' It was Ashley Turner,
beyond question. Creed stepped back a pace or
two and seemed at a loss for words. An object
slipped from Turner's pocket as he moved, slid
along the hay, and fell to the barn floor. It was
a half-filled whisky-flask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows full details of the conversation
that ensued, of course. Such little as I am able
to tell you of what was said and done comes
through old Ike, who watched from a safe distance
outside the barn, ready to act at a moment's notice
as best suited his own safety and welfare. Of one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
thing Ike was certain&mdash;Creed lacked his usual
browbeating manner. He was apparently struggling
to assume an unwonted friendliness. Turner
was very drunk, but triumphant, and his satisfaction
over what he must have felt was the practical
joke of his life seemed to make him friendly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'I kept 'em all right,' he said again and again.
'I've got the proof. I wasn't working for nothing
all these months. I ain't fool enough yet to
throw away papers even when I'm drunk.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the watchful Ike's astonishment, Creed
evidently tried to persuade him to come into the
house for something to eat. Turner slid off the
haymow, found his steps too unsteady, laughed
foolishly, and suggested that Creed bring some food
to him there. 'Guess I've got a right to sleep in
the barn or house, whichever I want,' he said,
leering into Creed's face. The old usurer stood
there for a few minutes eying Turner thoughtfully.
Then he actually gave him a shoulder back onto
the hay, said something about finding a snack of
supper, and started out of the barn. In the doorway
he turned, looked back, then walked over
to the edge of the mow and groped on the floor
until he found the whisky-flask, picked it up, tossed
it into Turner's lap, and stumbled out of the barn
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was becoming interested in my own story and
somewhat pleased with the fluency of it, but my
audience annoyed me. There was intermittent
whispering, with some laughter, and I inferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
that one or another would occasionally stimulate
this inattention by tickling a companion with a
straw. Miss Anstell, who is so frivolous by nature
that I sometimes question her right to a place
in my classroom, I even suspected of irritating
the back of my own neck in the same fashion.
Naturally, I ignored it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peter Creed,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;went into the
house. Ike hung around the barn, waiting. He
was frankly curious. In a few minutes his employer
reappeared, carrying a plate heaped with
an assortment of scraps. Ike peered and listened
then without compunction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'It's the best I've got,' he heard Creed say
grudgingly. Turner's tones were now more drunkenly
belligerent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'It had better be,' he said loudly. 'And I'll
take the best bed after to-night.' Evidently he
was eating and muttering between mouthfuls.
'You might have brought me another bottle.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'I did,' said Creed, to the listening Ike's great
astonishment. Turner laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A long silence followed. Turner was either
eating or drinking. Then he spoke again, more
thickly and drowsily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Damn unpleasant that rope. Why don't
you haul it up out of my way?'</p>

<p>&ldquo;'It don't hurt you any,' said Creed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Don't you wish it would?' said Turner, with
drunken shrewdness. 'But I don't like it. Haul
it away.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;'I will,' said Creed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a longer silence, and then there
came an intermittent rasping sound. A moment
later Creed came suddenly from the barn. Ike
fumbled with a large rake, and made as though
to hang it on its accustomed peg near the barn
door. Creed eyed him sharply. 'Get along to
bed,' he ordered, and Ike obeyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a Saturday night. On Sunday
morning Ike went to the barn later than usual and
hesitatingly. Even then he was first to enter.
He found the drunkard's body hanging here over
the mow, just about where we are sitting, stark
and cold. It was a gruesome end to a miserable
home-coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My audience was quiet enough now. Miss
Anstell and one or two others giggled loudly, but
it was obviously forced, and found no further
echo. The breeze which had sprung up some time
before was producing strange creakings and raspings
in the old timbers, and the pulley-wheel far
above us clanked with a dismal repetitious sound,
like the tolling of a cracked bell.</p>

<p>I waited a moment, well satisfied with the effect,
and then continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coroner's jury found it suicide, though
some shook their heads meaningly. Turner had
apparently sobered up enough to stand, and,
making a simple loop around his neck by catching
the rope through its own hook, had then slid off
the mow. The rope which went over the pulley-wheel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
up there in the roof ran out through a
window under the eaves, and was made fast near
the barn door outside, where anyone could haul
on it. Creed testified the knot was one he had
tied many days before. Ike was a timorous old
man, with a wholesome fear of his employer, and
he supported the testimony and made no reference
to his eavesdropping of the previous evening,
though he heard Creed swear before the jury that
he did not recognize the tramp he had fed and
lodged. There were no papers in Turner's pockets;
only a few coins, and a marked pocket-knife that
gave the first clue to his identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few of the neighbors said that it was a fitting
end, and that the verdict was a just one. Nevertheless,
whisperings began and increased. People
avoided Creed and the neighborhood. Rumors
grew that the barn was haunted. Passers-by on
the road after dark said they heard the old pulley-wheel
clanking when no breeze stirred, much as
you hear it now. Some claim to have heard
maudlin laughter. Possible purchasers were
frightened away, and Creed grew more and more
solitary and misanthropic. Old Ike hung on,
Heaven knows why, though I suppose Creed paid
him some sort of wage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rumors grew. Folks said that neither Ike
nor Creed entered this barn after a time, and no
hay was put in, though Creed would not have been
Creed if he had not sold off the bulk of what
he had, ghost or no ghost. I can imagine him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
slowly forking it out alone, daytimes, and the
amount of hay still here proves that even he
finally lost courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I paused a moment, but though there was much
uneasy stirring about, and the dismal clanking
directly above us was incessant, no one of my
audience spoke. It was wholly dark now, and I
think all had drawn closer together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About ten years ago people began calling
Creed crazy.&rdquo; Here I was forced to interrupt my
own story. &ldquo;I shall have to ask you, Miss
Anstell, to stop annoying me. I have been aware
for some moments that you are brushing my head
with a straw, but I have ignored it for the sake
of the others.&rdquo; Out of the darkness came Miss
Anstell's voice, protesting earnestly, and I realized
from the direction of the sound that in the general
readjustment she must have settled down in the
very center of our circle, and could not be the one
at fault. One of the others was childish enough
to simulate a mocking burst of raucous laughter,
but I chose to ignore it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, graciously; &ldquo;shall I go on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; echoed a subdued chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the night of the twenty-eighth of May,
ten years ago&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the twenty-eighth,&rdquo; broke in my wife's
voice, sharply; &ldquo;that is to-day's date.&rdquo; There was
a note in her voice that I hardly recognized, but it
indicated that she was in some way affected by my
narration, and I felt a distinct sense of triumph.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the night of May twenty-eighth,&rdquo; I
repeated firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you making up this story?&rdquo; my wife's
voice continued, still with the same odd tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, my dear, and you are interrupting it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But an Ashley Turner and later a Peter Creed
owned this place,&rdquo; she persisted almost in a
whisper, &ldquo;and I am sure you never heard of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confess that I might wisely have broken off
my story then and called for a light. There had
been an hysterical note in my wife's voice, and I
was startled at her words, for I had no conscious
recollection of either name; yet I felt a resultant
exhilaration. Our lanterns had grown strangely
dim, though I was certain both had been recently
trimmed and filled; and from their far corner of
the barn they threw no light whatever into our
circle. I faced an utter blackness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On that night,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;old Ike was wakened
by sounds as of someone fumbling to unbar and
open the housedoor. It was an unwonted hour,
and he peered from the window of his little room.
By the dim starlight&mdash;it was just before dawn&mdash;he
could see all of the open yard and roadway before
the house, with the great barn looming like a
black and sinister shadow as its farther barrier.
Crossing this space, he saw the figure of Peter
Creed, grotesquely stooped and old in the obscuring
gloom, moving slowly, almost gropingly, and
yet directly, as though impelled, toward the barn's
overwhelming shadow. Slowly he unbarred the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
great door, swung it open, and entered the blacker
shadows it concealed. The door closed after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ike in his secure post of observation did not
stir. He could not. Even to his crude imagining
there was something utterly horrible in the thought
of Creed alone at that hour in just such black
darkness as this, with the great timbered chamber
haunted at least by its dread memories. He could
only wait, tense and fearful of he knew not what.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shriek that pierced the silence relaxed his tension,
bringing almost a sense of relief, so definite
had been his expectancy. But it was a burst of
shrill laughter, ribald, uncanny, undeniable, accompanying
the shriek that gave him power of
motion. He ran half naked a quarter of a mile to
the nearest neighbor's and told his story.&rdquo;</p>

<br />

<p>&ldquo;They found Creed hanging, the rope hooked
simply around his neck. It was a silent jury that
filed from the barn that morning after viewing the
body. 'Suicide,' said they, after Ike, shivering
and stammering, had testified, harking back to
the untold evidence of that other morning years
before. Yes, Creed was dead, with a terrible
look on his wizen face, and the dusty old rope ran
through its pulley-wheel and was fast to a beam
high above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'He must of climbed to the beam, made the
rope fast, and jumped,' said the foreman, solemnly.
'He must of, he must of,' repeated the man, parrot-like,
while the sweat stood out on his forehead,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
'because there wasn't no other way; but as God
is my judge, the knot in the rope and the dust on
the beam ain't been disturbed for years.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this dramatic climax there was an audible
sigh from my audience. I sat quietly for a time,
content to allow the silence and the atmosphere
of the place, which actually seemed surcharged
with influences not of my creation, to add
to the effect my story had caused. There was
scarcely a movement in our circle; of that I felt
sure. And yet once more, out of the almost
tangible darkness above me, something seemed
to reach down and brush against my head. A
slight motion of air, sufficient to disturb my rather
scanty locks, was additional proof that I was
the butt of some prank that had just missed its
objective. Then, with a fearful suddenness, close
to my ear burst a shrill discord of laughter, so uncanny
and so unlike the usual sound of student
merriment that I started up, half wondering if I
had heard it. Almost immediately after it the
heavy darkness was torn again by a shriek so
terrible in its intensity as completely to differentiate
it from the other cries which followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring a light!&rdquo; cried a voice that I recognized
as that of my wife, though strangely distorted by
emotion. There was a great confusion. Young
women struggled from their places and impeded
one another in the darkness; but finally, and it
seemed an unbearable delay, someone brought
a single lantern.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Its frail light revealed Miss Anstell half upright
from her place in the center of our circle, my wife's
arms sustaining her weight. Her face, as well as
I could see it, seemed darkened and distorted,
and when we forced her clutching hands away
from her bared throat we could see, even in that
light, the marks of an angry, throttling scar
entirely encircling it. Just above her head the
old pulley-rope swayed menacingly in the faint
breeze.</p>

<p>My recollection is even now confused as to the
following moments and our stumbling escape from
that gruesome spot. Miss Anstell is now at her
home, recovering from what her physician calls
mental shock. My wife will not speak of it. The
questions I would ask her are checked on my lips
by the look of utter terror in her eyes. As I have
confessed to you, my own philosophy is hard put
to it to withstand not so much the community
attitude toward what they are pleased to call my
taste in practical joking, but to assemble and
adjust the facts of my experience.</p>

<h2>A Shady Plot</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> ELSIE BROWN</h4>


<p>So I sat down to write a ghost story.</p>

<p>Jenkins was responsible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallock,&rdquo; he had said to me, &ldquo;give us another
on the supernatural this time. Something to give
'em the horrors; that's what the public wants,
and your ghosts are live propositions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I was in no position to contradict Jenkins,
for, as yet, his magazine had been the only one to
print my stuff. So I had said, &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo; in
the deepest voice I was capable of, and had gone
out.</p>

<p>I hadn't the shade of an idea, but at the time
that didn't worry me in the least. You see, I
had often been like that before and in the end
things had always come my way&mdash;I didn't in the
least know how or why. It had all been rather
mysterious. You understand I didn't specialize
in ghost stories, but more or less they seemed to
specialize in me. A ghost story had been the first
fiction I had written. Curious how that idea for
a plot had come to me out of nowhere after I had
chased inspiration in vain for months! Even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
now whenever Jenkins wanted a ghost, he called
on me. And I had never found it healthy to contradict
Jenkins. Jenkins always seemed to have
an uncanny knowledge as to when the landlord
or the grocer were pestering me, and he dunned
me for a ghost. And somehow I'd always been
able to dig one up for him, so I'd begun to get a
bit cocky as to my ability.</p>

<p>So I went home and sat down before my desk
and sucked at the end of my pencil and waited,
but nothing happened. Pretty soon my mind
began to wander off on other things, decidedly
unghostly and material things, such as my wife's
shopping and how on earth I was going to cure her
of her alarming tendency to take every new fad
that came along and work it to death. But I
realized <i>that</i> would never get me any place, so I
went back to staring at the ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This writing business <i>is</i> delightful, isn't it?&rdquo;
I said sarcastically at last, out loud, too. You
see, I had reached the stage of imbecility when I
was talking to myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said a voice at the other end of the
room, &ldquo;I should say it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I admit I jumped. Then I looked around.</p>

<p>It was twilight by this time and I had forgotten
to turn on the lamp. The other end of the room
was full of shadows and furniture. I sat staring
at it and presently noticed something just taking
shape. It was exactly like watching one of these
moving picture cartoons being put together. First<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
an arm came out, then a bit of sleeve of a stiff
white shirtwaist, then a leg and a plaid skirt, until
at last there she was complete,&mdash;whoever she was.</p>

<p>She was long and angular, with enormous fishy
eyes behind big bone-rimmed spectacles, and her
hair in a tight wad at the back of her head (yes, I
seemed able to see right through her head) and a
jaw&mdash;well, it looked so solid that for the moment I
began to doubt my very own senses and believe
she was real after all.</p>

<p>She came over and stood in front of me and
glared&mdash;yes, positively glared down at me, although
(to my knowledge) I had never laid eyes
on the woman before, to say nothing of giving
her cause to look at me like that.</p>

<p>I sat still, feeling pretty helpless I can tell you,
and at last she barked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you gaping at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I swallowed, though I hadn't been chewing
anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Absolutely nothing. My
dear lady, I was merely waiting for you to tell me
why you had come. And excuse me, but do you
always come in sections like this? I should think
your parts might get mixed up sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn't you send for me?&rdquo; she crisped.</p>

<p>Imagine how I felt at that!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no. I&mdash;I don't seem to remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here. Haven't you been calling on
heaven and earth all afternoon to help you write
a story?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>I nodded, and then a possible explanation occurred
to me and my spine got cold. Suppose
this was the ghost of a stenographer applying for a
job! I had had an advertisement in the paper
recently. I opened my mouth to explain that the
position was filled, and permanently so, but she
stopped me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I got back to the office from my
last case and was ready for you, didn't you switch
off to something else and sit there driveling so I
couldn't attract your attention until just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I'm very sorry, really.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you needn't be, because I just came to
tell you to stop bothering us for assistance; you
ain't going to get it. We're going on Strike!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't have to yell at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't mean to yell,&rdquo; I said humbly.
&ldquo;But I'm afraid I didn't quite understand you.
You said you were&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going on strike. Don't you know what a
strike is? Not another plot do you get from us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stared at her and wet my lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is that where they've been coming from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Where else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my ghosts aren't a bit like you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they were people wouldn't believe in them.&rdquo;
She draped herself on the top of my desk among
the pens and ink bottles and leaned towards me.
&ldquo;In the other life <i>I</i> used to write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that has nothing to do with my present
form. It might have, but I gave it up at last for
that very reason, and went to work as a reader on
a magazine.&rdquo; She sighed, and rubbed the end of
her long eagle nose with a reminiscent finger.
&ldquo;Those were terrible days; the memory of them
made me mistake purgatory for paradise, and at
last when I attained my present state of being, I
made up my mind that something should be done.
I found others who had suffered similarly, and
between us we organized 'The Writer's Inspiration
Bureau.' We scout around until we find a writer
without ideas and with a mind soft enough to accept
impression. The case is brought to the attention
of the main office, and one of us assigned to it.
When that case is finished we bring in a report.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I never saw you before&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn't have this time if I hadn't
come to announce the strike. Many a time I've
leaned on your shoulder when you've thought <i>you</i>
were thinking hard&mdash;&rdquo; I groaned, and clutched
my hair. The very idea of that horrible scarecrow
so much as touching me! and wouldn't
my wife be shocked! I shivered. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;that's at an end. We've been called
out of our beds a little too often in recent years,
and now we're through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my dear madam, I assure you I have had
nothing to do with that. I hope I'm properly
grateful and all that, you see.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn't you,&rdquo; she explained patronizingly.
&ldquo;It's those Ouija board fanatics. There was a
time when we had nothing much to occupy us
and used to haunt a little on the side, purely
for amusement, but not any more. We've had
to give up haunting almost entirely. We sit at
a desk and answer questions now. And such
questions!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head hopelessly, and taking off her
glasses wiped them, and put them back on her
nose again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what have I got to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me a pitying look and rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You're to exert your influence. Get all your
friends and acquaintances to stop using the Ouija
board, and then we'll start helping you to write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a footstep outside my door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John! Oh, John!&rdquo; called the voice of my wife.</p>

<p>I waved my arms at the ghost with something
of the motion of a beginner when learning to swim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, I must ask you to leave, and at once.
Consider the impression if you were seen here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost nodded, and began, very sensibly,
I thought, to demobilize and evaporate. First the
brogans on her feet grew misty until I could see
the floor through them, then the affection spread
to her knees and gradually extended upward. By
this time my wife was opening the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't forget the strike,&rdquo; she repeated, while
her lower jaw began to disintegrate, and as my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Lavinia crossed the room to me the last vestige of
her ear faded into space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, why in the world are you sitting in the
dark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just&mdash;thinking, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thinking, rubbish! You were talking out
loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remained silent while she lit the lamps, thankful
that her back was turned to me. When I am
nervous or excited there is a muscle in my face
that starts to twitch, and this pulls up one corner
of my mouth and gives the appearance of an
idiotic grin. So far I had managed to conceal
this affliction from Lavinia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I bought the loveliest thing this
afternoon. Everybody's wild over them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remembered her craze for taking up new fads
and a premonitory chill crept up the back of my neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it isn't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began and stopped. I simply
couldn't ask; the possibility was too horrible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'd never guess in the world. It's the
duckiest, darlingest Ouija board, and so cheap!
I got it at a bargain sale. Why, what's the
matter, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt things slipping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I said, and looked around for the
ghost. Suppose she had lingered, and upon hearing
what my wife had said should suddenly appear&mdash;&mdash;Like
all sensitive women, Lavinia was
subject to hysterics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you looked so funny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I always do when I'm interested,&rdquo; I gulped.
&ldquo;But don't you think that was a foolish thing to
buy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foolish! Oh, John! Foolish! And after me
getting it for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To help you write your stories. Why, for
instance, suppose you wanted to write an historical
novel. You wouldn't have to wear your eyes
out over those musty old books in the public
library. All you'd have to do would be to get
out your Ouija and talk to Napoleon, or William
the Conqueror, or Helen of Troy&mdash;well, maybe
not Helen&mdash;anyhow you'd have all the local color
you'd need, and without a speck of trouble. And
think how easy writing your short stories will
be now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Lavinia, you surely don't believe in
Ouija boards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know, John&mdash;they are awfully
thrilling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had seated herself on the arm of my chair
and was looking dreamily across the room. I
started and turned around. There was nothing
there, and I sank back with relief. So far so good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, they're thrilling all right.
That's just it, they're a darn sight too thrilling.
They're positively devilish. Now, Lavinia, you
have plenty of sense, and I want you to get rid of
that thing just as soon as you can. Take it back
and get something else.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>My wife crossed her knees and stared at me
through narrowed lids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Hallock,&rdquo; she said distinctly. &ldquo;I don't
propose to do anything of the kind. In the first
place they won't exchange things bought at a
bargain sale, and in the second, if you aren't
interested in the other world <i>I</i> am. So there!&rdquo;
and she slid down and walked from the room before
I could think of a single thing to say. She walked
very huffily.</p>

<p>Well, it was like that all the rest of the evening.
Just as soon as I mentioned Ouija boards I felt
things begin to cloud up; so I decided to let it go
for the present, in the hope that she might be more
reasonable later.</p>

<p>After supper I had another try at the writing,
but as my mind continued a perfect blank I gave
it up and went off to bed.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday, and it being near
the end of the month and a particularly busy day,
I left home early without seeing Lavinia. Understand,
I haven't quite reached the point where I
can give my whole time to writing, and being
bookkeeper for a lumber company does help with
the grocery bills and pay for Lavinia's fancy shopping.
Friday had been a half holiday, and of
course when I got back the work was piled up
pretty high; so high, in fact, that ghosts and stories
and everything else vanished in a perfect tangle of
figures.</p>

<p>When I got off the street car that evening my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
mind was still churning. I remember now that I
noticed, even from the corner, how brightly the
house was illuminated, but at the time that didn't
mean anything to me. I recall as I went up the
steps and opened the door I murmured:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine times nine is eighty-one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Gladolia met me in the hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misto Hallock, de Missus sho t'inks you's lost!
She say she done 'phone you dis mawnin' to be
home early, but fo' de lawd's sake not to stop to
argify now, but get ready fo' de company an' come
on down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some memory of a message given me by one of the
clerks filtered back through my brain, but I had
been hunting three lost receipts at the time, and
had completely forgotten it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Company?&rdquo; I said stupidly. &ldquo;What
company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De Missus's Ouija boahrd pahrty,&rdquo; said
Gladolia, and rolling her eyes she disappeared in
the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>I must have gone upstairs and dressed and come
down again, for I presently found myself standing
in the dimly lighted lower hall wearing my second
best suit and a fresh shirt and collar. But I have
no recollections of the process.</p>

<p>There was a great chattering coming from our
little parlor and I went over to the half-opened
door and peered through.</p>

<p>The room was full of women&mdash;most of them
elderly&mdash;whom I recognized as belonging to my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
wife's Book Club. They were sitting in couples,
and between each couple was a Ouija board! The
mournful squeak of the legs of the moving triangular
things on which they rested their fingers
filled the air and mixed in with the conversation.
I looked around for the ghost with my heart sunk
down to zero. What if Lavinia should see her
and go mad before my eyes! And then my wife
came and tapped me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said in her sweetest voice, and I
noticed that her cheeks were very pink and her
eyes very bright. My wife is never so pretty as
when she's doing something she knows I disapprove
of, &ldquo;John, dear I know you'll help us out.
Mrs. William Augustus Wainright 'phoned at the
last moment to say that she couldn't possibly
come, and that leaves poor Laura Hinkle without
a partner. Now, John, I know <i>some</i> people can
work a Ouija by themselves, but Laura can't, and
she'll just have a horrible time unless you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;Me! I won't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; but even
as I spoke she had taken my arm, and the next
thing I knew I was sitting with the thing on my
knees and Miss Laura Hinkle opposite, grinning
in my face like a flirtatious crocodile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I won't&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Hallock, don't you be shy.&rdquo; Miss
Laura Hinkle leaned forward and shook a bony
finger almost under my chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I'm not! Only I say I won't&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it's very easy, really. You just put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
tips of your fingers right here beside the tips of my
fingers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the first thing I knew she had taken my
hands and was coyly holding them in the position
desired. She released them presently, and the
little board began to slide around in an aimless
sort of way. There seemed to be some force tugging
it about. I looked at my partner, first with
suspicion, and then with a vast relief. If she was
doing it, then all that talk about spirits&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
I did hope Miss Laura Hinkle was cheating with
that board!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ouija, dear, won't you tell us something?&rdquo;
she cooed, and on the instant the thing seemed to
take life.</p>

<p>It rushed to the upper left hand corner of the
board and hovered with its front leg on the word
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then it began to fly around so fast that
I gave up any attempt to follow it. My companion
was bending forward and had started to
spell out loud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'T-r-a-i-t-o-r.' Traitor! Why, what does she
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; I said desperately. My collar
felt very tight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she must mean something. Ouija, dear,
won't you explain yourself more fully?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;'A-s-k-h-i-m!' Ask him. Ask who, Ouija?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I'm going.&rdquo; I choked and tried to get
up but my fingers seemed stuck to that dreadful
board and I dropped back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>Apparently Miss Hinkle had not heard my
protest. The thing was going around faster than
ever and she was reading the message silently,
with her brow corrugated, and the light of the
huntress in her pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, she says it's you, Mr. Hallock. What
<i>does</i> she mean? Ouija, won't you tell us who is
talking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I groaned, but that inexorable board continued
to spell. I always did hate a spelling match!
Miss Hinkle was again following it aloud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'H-e-l-e-n.' Helen!&rdquo; She raised her voice
until it could be heard at the other end of the room.
&ldquo;Lavinia, dear, do you know anyone by the name
of Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the name of&mdash;&mdash;? I can't hear you.&rdquo; And
my wife made her way over to us between the
Book Club's chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the funniest thing has happened,&rdquo;
she whispered excitedly. &ldquo;Someone had been
trying to communicate with John through Mrs.
Hunt's and Mrs. Sprinkle's Ouija! Someone by
the name of Helen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>isn't</i> that curious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Hinkle simpered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone giving the name of Helen has just
been calling for your husband here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we don't know anyone by the name of
Helen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lavinia stopped and began to look at me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
through narrowed lids much as she had done in
the library the evening before.</p>

<p>And then from different parts of the room other
manipulators began to report. Every plagued
one of those five Ouija boards was calling me by
name! I felt my ears grow crimson, purple,
maroon. My wife was looking at me as though I
were some peculiar insect. The squeak of Ouija
boards and the murmur of conversation rose louder
and louder, and then I felt my face twitch in the
spasm of that idiotic grin. I tried to straighten
my wretched features into their usual semblance
of humanity, I tried and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn't he look sly!&rdquo; said Miss Hinkle. And
then I got up and fled from the room.</p>

<p>I do not know how that party ended. I do not
want to know. I went straight upstairs, and undressed
and crawled into bed, and lay there in the
burning dark while the last guest gurgled in the
hall below about the wonderful evening she had
spent. I lay there while the front door shut
after her, and Lavinia's steps came up the
stairs and&mdash;passed the door to the guest room
beyond. And then after a couple of centuries
elapsed the clock struck three and I dozed off to
sleep.</p>

<p>At the breakfast table the next morning there
was no sign of my wife. I concluded she was
sleeping late, but Gladolia, upon being questioned,
only shook her head, muttered something, and
turned the whites of her eyes up to the ceiling. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
was glad when the meal was over and hurried to
the library for another try at that story.</p>

<p>I had hardly seated myself at the desk when
there came a tap at the door and a white slip of
paper slid under it. I unfolded it and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noindent">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear John,</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going back to my grandmother. My
lawyer will communicate with you later.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Oh, I wish I was dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's exactly what you ought to be!&rdquo; said
that horrible voice from the other end of the room.</p>

<p>I sat up abruptly&mdash;I had sunk into a chair under
the blow of the letter&mdash;then I dropped back again
and my hair rose in a thick prickle on the top of
my head. Coming majestically across the floor
towards me was a highly polished pair of thick
laced shoes. I stared at them in a sort of dreadful
fascination, and then something about their gait
attracted my attention and I recognized them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; I said sternly. &ldquo;What do you
mean by appearing here like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> can't help it,&rdquo; said the voice, which seemed
to come from a point about five and a half feet
above the shoes. I raised my eyes and presently
distinguished her round protruding mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can't you? A nice way to act, to walk in
in sections&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you'll give me time,&rdquo; said the mouth in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
exasperated voice, &ldquo;I assure you the rest of me will
presently arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what's the matter with you? You never
acted this way before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed stung to make a violent effort, for a
portion of a fishy eye and the end of her nose
popped into view with a suddenness that made
me jump.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's all your fault.&rdquo; She glared at me, while
part of her hair and her plaid skirt began slowly
to take form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My fault!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. How can you keep a lady up
working all night and then expect her to retain all
her faculties the next day? I'm just too tired to
materialize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why did you bother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was sent to ask when your wife is
going to get rid of that Ouija board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know! I wish to heaven I'd
never seen you!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Look what you've
done! You've lost me my wife, you've lost me
my home and happiness, you've&mdash;&mdash;you've&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misto Hallock,&rdquo; came from the hall outside,
&ldquo;Misto Hallock, I's gwine t' quit. I don't like
no hoodoos.&rdquo; And the steps retreated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You've&mdash;&mdash;you've lost me my cook&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't come here to be abused,&rdquo; said the ghost
coldly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the door opened and Lavinia entered.
She wore the brown hat and coat she usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
travels in and carried a suitcase which she set
down on the floor.</p>

<p>That suitcase had an air of solid finality about
it, and its lock leered at me brassily.</p>

<p>I leaped from my chair with unaccustomed
agility and sprang in front of my wife. I must
conceal that awful phantom from her, at any risk!</p>

<p>She did not look at me, or&mdash;thank heaven!&mdash;behind
me, but fixed her injured gaze upon the
waste-basket, as if to wrest dark secrets from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to tell you that I am leaving,&rdquo;
she staccatoed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; I agreed, flapping my arms
about to attract attention from the corner.
&ldquo;That's fine&mdash;great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you want me to go, do you?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, yes&mdash;right away! Change of air will
do you good. I'll join you presently!&rdquo; If only
she would go till Helen could <i>de</i>-part! I'd have
the devil of a time explaining afterward, of course,
but anything would be better than to have Lavinia
see a ghost. Why, that sensitive little woman
couldn't bear to have a mouse say boo at her&mdash;and
what would she say to a ghost in her own living-room?</p>

<p>Lavinia cast a cold eye upon me. &ldquo;You are
acting very queerly,&rdquo; she sniffed. &ldquo;You are concealing
something from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the door opened and Gladolia called,
&ldquo;Mis' Hallock! Mis' Hallock! I've come to tell
you I'se done lef' dis place.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>My wife turned her head a moment. &ldquo;But
why, Gladolia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain't stayin' round no place 'long wid dem
Ouija board contraptions. I'se skeered of hoodoos.
I's done gone, I is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all you've got to complain about?&rdquo;
Lavinia inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, then. Go back to the kitchen. You
can use the board for kindling wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Me touch dat t'ing? No, ma'am,
not dis nigger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll be the coon to burn it,&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;I'll
be glad to burn it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gladolia's heavy steps moved off kitchenward.</p>

<p>Then my Lavinia turned waspishly to me again.
&ldquo;John, there's not a bit of use trying to deceive me.
What is it you are trying to conceal from me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Me? Oh, no,&rdquo; I lied elaborately,
looking around to see if that dratted ghost was
concealed enough. She was so big, and I'm rather
a smallish man. But that was a bad move on my
part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; Lavinia demanded like a ward boss,
&ldquo;you are hiding some<i>body</i> in here! Who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I only waved denial and gurgled in my throat.
She went on, &ldquo;It's bad enough to have you flirt
over the Ouija board with that hussy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the affair was quite above-board, I assure
you, my love!&rdquo; I cried, leaping lithely about to
keep her from focusing her gaze behind me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>She thrust me back with sudden muscle. &ldquo;<i>I
will</i> see who's behind you! Where is that Helen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? I'm Helen,&rdquo; came from the ghost.</p>

<p>Lavinia looked at that apparition, that owl-eyed
phantom, in plaid skirt and stiff shirtwaist,
with hair skewed back and no powder on her nose.
I threw a protecting husbandly arm about her to
catch her when she should faint. But she didn't
swoon. A broad, satisfied smile spread over her
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were Helen of Troy,&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to be Helen of Troy, New York,&rdquo; said
the ghost. &ldquo;And now I'll be moving along, if
you'll excuse me. See you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that she telescoped briskly, till we saw
only a hand waving farewell.</p>

<p>My Lavinia fell forgivingly into my arms. I
kissed her once or twice fervently, and then I
shoved her aside, for I felt a sudden strong desire
to write. The sheets of paper on my desk spread
invitingly before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got the bulliest plot for a ghost story!&rdquo;
I cried.</p>

<h2>The Lady and the Ghost</h2>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>
<h4><span class="smcap">By</span> ROSE CECIL O'NEILL</h4>


<p>It was some moments before the Lady became
rationally convinced that there was something
occurring in the corner of the room, and then the
actual nature of the thing was still far from clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put it as mildly as possible,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;the thing verges upon the uncanny&rdquo;; and, leaning
forward upon her silken knees, she attended
upon the phenomenon.</p>

<p>At first it had seemed like some faint and unexplained
atmospheric derangement, occasioned,
apparently, neither by an opened window nor by
a door. Some papers fluttered to the floor, the
fringes of the hangings softly waved, and, indeed,
it would still have been easy to dismiss the matter
as the effect of a vagrant draft had not the state
of things suddenly grown unmistakably unusual.
All the air of the room, it then appeared, rushed
even with violence to the point and there underwent
what impressed her as an aerial convulsion,
in the very midst and well-spring of which, so
great was the confusion, there seemed to appear
at intervals almost the semblance of a shape.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>The silence of the room was disturbed by a book
that flew open with fluttering leaves, the noise of a
vase of violets blown over, from which the perfumed
water dripped to the floor, and soft touchings
all around as of a breeze passing through a
chamber full of trifles.</p>

<p>The ringlets of the Lady's hair were swept forward
toward the corner upon which her gaze was
fixed, and in which the conditions had now grown
so tense with imminent occurrence and so rent
with some inconceivable throe that she involuntarily
rose, and, stepping forward against the
pressure of her petticoats which were blown about
her ankles, she impatiently thrust her hand into
the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She was immediately aware that another hand
had received it, though with a far from substantial
envelopment, and for another moment what
she saw before her trembled between something
and nothing. Then from the precarious situation
there slowly emerged into dubious view the shape
of a young man dressed in evening clothes over
which was flung a mantle of voluminous folds
such as is worn by ghosts of fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very deuce was in it!&rdquo; he complained; &ldquo;I
thought I should never materialize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flung herself into her chair, confounded;
yet, even in the shock of the emergency, true to
herself, she did not fail to smooth her ruffled locks.</p>

<p>Her visitor had been scanning his person in a
dissatisfied way, and with some vexation he now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
ejaculated: &ldquo;Beg your pardon, my dear, but are
my feet on the floor, or where in thunder are
they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was with a tone of reassurance that she confessed
that his patent-leathers were the trivial
matter of two or three inches from the rug.
Whereupon, with still another effort, he brought
himself down until his feet rested decently upon
the floor. It was only when he walked about to
examine the bric-&agrave;-brac that a suspicious lightness
was discernible in his tread.</p>

<p>When he had composed himself by the survey,
effecting it with an air of great insouciance, which,
however, failed to conceal the fact that his heart
was beating somewhat wildly, he approached the
Lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are again, my love!&rdquo; he cried,
and devoured her hands with ghostly kisses. &ldquo;It
seems an eternity that I've been struggling back
to you through the outer void and what-not.
Sometimes, I confess I all but despaired. Life is
not, I assure you, all beer and skittles for the
disembodied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, and his gaze upon her
and the entire chamber seemed to envelop all and
cherish it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little room, little room! And so you are
thus! Do you know,&rdquo; he continued, with vivacity,
&ldquo;I have wondered about it in the grave, and I
could hardly sleep for this place unpenetrated.
Heigho! What a lot of things we leave undone!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
I dashed this off at the time, the literary passion
strong in me, thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now, when all is done, and I lie so low,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I cannot sleep for this, my only care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though of that dim place I could not know;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That where my heart was fain I did not go,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor saw you musing there!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, these things irk a ghost so. Naturally,
as soon as possible I made my way back&mdash;to be satisfied&mdash;to
be satisfied that you were still
mine.&rdquo; He bent a piercing look upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I observe by the calendar on your writing-table
that some years have elapsed since my&mdash;&mdash;um&mdash;&mdash;since
I expired,&rdquo; he added, with a faint
blush. It appears that the matter of their dissolution
is, in conversation, rather kept in the
background by well-bred ghosts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heigho! How time does fly! You'll be joining
me soon, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew herself splendidly up, and he was
aware of her beauty in the full of its tenacious
excellence&mdash;of the delicate insolence of Life looking
upon Death&mdash;of the fact <i>that she had forgotten him</i>.</p>

<p>He rose, and confronted this, his trembling
hands thrust into his pockets, then turned away
to hide the dismay of his countenance. He was,
however, a spook of considerable spirit, and in a
jiffy he met the occasion. To her blank, indignant
gaze he drew a card from his case, and, taking a pencil
from the secretary, wrote, beneath the name:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Quiet to the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wheresoe'er it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That gave an hour's rest<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the heart of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quiet to the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till it lieth dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the heart be clay<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where I visited.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quiet to the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Though forgetting quite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The guest it sheltered once;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the heart, good night!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Handing her the card he bowed, and, through
force of habit, turned to the door, forgetting that
his ghostly pressure would not turn the knob.</p>

<p>As the door did not open, with a sigh of recollection
for his spiritual condition, he prepared to disappear,
casting one last look at the faithless Lady.
She was still looking at the card in her hand, and
the tears ran down her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has remembered,&rdquo; he reflected; &ldquo;how
courteous!&rdquo; For a moment it seemed he could
contain his disappointment, discreetly removing
himself now at what he felt was the vanishing-point,
with the customary reticence of the dead, but feeling
overcame him. In an instant he had her in
his arms, and was pouring out his love, his reproaches,
the story of his longing, his doubts, his
discontent, and his desperate journey back to earth
for a sight of her. &ldquo;And, ah!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;picture
my agony at finding that you had forgotten. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
yet I surmised it in the gloom. I divined it by
my restlessness and my despair. Perhaps some
lines that occurred to me will suggest the thing to
you&mdash;you recall my old knack for versification?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Where the grasses weep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er his darkling bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glow-worms creep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lies the weary head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one laid deep, who cannot sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The unremembered dead.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He took a chair beside her, and spoke of their
old love for each other, of his fealty through all
transmutations; incidentally of her beauty, of her
cruelty, of the light of her face which had illumined
his darksome way to her&mdash;and of a lot of other
things&mdash;and the Lady bowed her head, and wept.</p>

<p>The hours of the night passed thus: the moon
waned, and a pallor began to tinge the dusky cheek
of the east, but the eloquence of the visitor still
flowed on, and the Lady had his misty hands
clasped to her reawakened bosom. At last a
suspicion of rosiness touched the curtain. He
abruptly rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot hold out against the morning,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;it is time all good ghosts were in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she threw herself on her knees before him,
clasping his ethereal waist with a despairing
embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not leave me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;or my love
will kill me!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>He bent eagerly above her. &ldquo;Say it again&mdash;convince
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she cried, again and again and
again, with such an anguish of sincerity as would
convince the most skeptical spook that ever
revisited the glimpses of the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will forget again,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My life
will henceforth be one continual remembrance of
you, one long act of devotion to your memory,
one oblation, one unceasing penitence, one agony
of waiting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted her face, and saw that it was true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, gracefully wrapping his cloak
about him, &ldquo;well, now I shall have a little peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her, with a certain jaunty grace, upon
her hair, and prepared to dissolve, while he lightly
tapped a tattoo upon his leg with the dove-colored
gloves he carried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by, my dear!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;henceforth I
shall sleep o' nights; my heart is quite at rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But mine is breaking,&rdquo; she wailed, madly
trying once more to clasp his vanishing form.</p>

<p>He threw her a kiss from his misty finger-tips,
and all that remained with her, besides her broken
heart, was a faint disturbance of the air.</p>

<h1>A Southern Porch</h1>

<h4>By<br />
<br />
Dorothy Scarborough<br />
<br />
<i>A Book of Whimsy</i></h4>

<p>The author does not preach the lost art of loafing.
No! Nothing so direct as preaching. She
merely loafs,&mdash;consistently, restfully, delightfully,
but with an almost fatal hypnotic persuasiveness.
She is a sort of stationary Pied Piper, luring the
unwary reader to her sun-flecked porch, to watch
with her the queer procession of created things
go by,&mdash;from lovers and ghosts to lizards and
toads.</p>

<p>Under the spell, convinced that loafing is better
than doing, the reader stays and chuckles over
the quiet humor and quaint fancies. He gets
away finally,&mdash;all delightful experiences must
end in this work-a-day world,&mdash;still chuckling,
but with a renewed sense of life and life's values.</p>

<p>Certainly no single individual has done more
than Lady Gregory to revive the Irish Literature,
and to bring again to light the brave
old legends, the old heroic poems. From her
childhood, the author has studied this ancient
language, and has collected most of her material
from close association with the peasants
who have inherited these poems and tales.</p>
